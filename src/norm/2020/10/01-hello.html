<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<p>A month to the day since I started working at Saxonica, I’m writing
my first weblog posting. I’ll be perfectly honest, it’s mostly to test
that the (new) weblog infrastructure is working. (I’m the new guy, so
I’m doing a few infrastructure-y things. But I’ve also fixed a couple
of bugs! And I have bigger plans!)</p>

<p>We’ve upgraded some of the servers (By “we” I mean mostly O’Neil.
Thank you O’Neil!) and I’ve moved the weblog out of Movable Type. It’s
now a flat collection of XML files that get published with Saxon. It
may be a little rough around the edges at the moment, but I don’t
think I accidentally lost anything. (We have decided not to republish
the comments from the old weblog.) If you find any broken links or
things that don’t look right, please let me know. The sort of markup you
get out of weblog tools is, uh, interesting.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, I’m moving our CI/CD infrastructure forward and
I hope to publish an experimental Maven repository for the Saxon EE
product “real soon now.”</p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure how I’ll divide up my writings between this
weblog and <a href="https://so.nwalsh.com/">my personal weblog</a>.
I’ll try to cross-link where it’s appropriate.</p>
