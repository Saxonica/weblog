<h1>Experimenting with Maven</h1>

<p>Do you have
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/license/license.xml">a license</a>
for Saxon PE or EE? Do you use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven">Maven</a>?
Would a Maven repository for Saxon PE or EE
be useful to you? (Saxon HE is already released into
<a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.sf.saxon/Saxon-HE">Maven Central</a>.)</p>

<p>I’ve sometimes thought it would be useful, and I fielded a customer
request for it, so I’ve tried to set it up. It’s a bit experimental at
the moment because I’m not entirely certain that I understand all of
the metadata files that are expected in a Maven repository.</p>

<p>I’ve only packaged up the Java release of Saxon 10.2 for the
moment, but if I can get it usefully configured, I’m happy to try to
make it part of the normal release process. We’re thinking of putting
some of the older releases up as well to simplify regression
testing.</p>

<p>The experimental Maven repository is at
<a href="https://dev.saxonica.com/maven/">https://dev.saxonica.com/maven/</a>.</p>

<p>If you can try it out and let me know if you have trouble (or if you don’t!),
I’d appreciate it.</p>
