<h1>More Maven experiments</h1>

<p>I haven’t actually looked at the server logs to see if anyone else
tried using our experimental Maven repository after
<a href="02-maven.html">I posted</a> about it earlier this month. But
I have, and it’s worked for me!
</p>

<p>I think we’d have to agree that it’s still experimental. After I
put up a raw set of files in a directory structure, a couple of folks
said I should be running a server to do this. I might do that, but I
haven’t had time to try it out yet.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, I’m also working on build automation.
Ultimately, I want these artifacts to be published automatically.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’ve added the 9.9.1-8 and 10.3 releases of HE (also
<a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.sf.saxon/Saxon-HE">available</a>
on Maven Central), PE, and EE to our Maven repository.</p>

<p>The experimental Maven repository is at
<a href="https://dev.saxonica.com/maven/">https://dev.saxonica.com/maven/</a>.</p>

<p>If you can try it out and let me know if you have trouble (or if you don’t!),
I’d appreciate it.</p>
