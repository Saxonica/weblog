<h1>Saxon-JS 2.0.3</h1>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>As of a few minutes ago (at time of publication!), Saxon-JS 2.0.3
has been published to the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/saxon-js">npm registry</a>.
This release contains no changes in functionality (this is not the
release you’ve been waiting for, we’re still working on that one).</p>

<p>The previous version has a published dependency on
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">axios</a> version 
0.19.2 which is, apparently, the subject of a security vulnerability
(or so <code>npm install</code> asserted this morning).</p>

<p>This tiny release simply updates the dependency to a patched
version of axios.</p>

<p>Axios is an HTTP library that is only used by the NodeJS version of
Saxon-JS. When Saxon-JS is running in the browser, it uses the
browser’s APIs, so this update should have no consequences for the
browser version at all.</p>
