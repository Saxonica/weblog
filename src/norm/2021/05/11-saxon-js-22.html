<h1>Saxon-JS 2.2</h1>

<p>Saxon-JS 2.2
has been published on
<a href="https://saxonica.com/saxon-js/">Saxonica.com</a> and to the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/saxon-js">npm registry</a>!</p>

<p>This is a maintenance release that fixes a few bugs. The big one, to my mind, is resolving
the “global object” bug in Node.js. Previous releases of Saxon-JS always
created a global object named “<code>SaxonJS</code>”. This isn’t best practice on
Node.js and interfered with some platforms like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">Electron</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack">Webpack</a>.</p>

<p>Starting with 2.2, on Node.js, the global object no longer gets created.
If you’ve consistently used</p>

<pre><code>const SaxonJS = require('saxon-js');</code></pre>

<p>to load Saxon-JS, you’ll be fine. If you’ve used some other name
for the object, make sure that you refer to Saxon-JS exclusively by
that name. For example:</p>

<pre><code>const <b>sjs</b> = require('saxon-js');
const six = <b>sjs</b>.XPath.evaluate("3+3");
console.log(`six = ${six}`)</code></pre>

<p>We fixed a few other bugs as detailed in the
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-js/documentation/index.html#!changes">change history</a>.
Thanks to everyone who took the time to report them!
