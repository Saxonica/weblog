<h1>SaxonC HE “11.99” pre-release</h1>

<p>Happy holidays everyone! Wishing you peace and joy in this festive season!</p>

<p>And toys.</p>

<p>Since we didn't get any releases out before Christmas, we've
packaged up a special treat for anyone who wants to play with
something new: SaxonC HE 12.0 in Python.</p>

<p>We've built and deployed the Python "wheels" for installing SaxonC
HE “11.99” (that's the 12.0 code base, but it's a test release so I
didn't want to use up one of the 12.x release numbers). You’ll find the
details at <a href="https://saxonica.com/saxon-c/1199/">https://saxonica.com/saxon-c/1199/</a>.
</p>

<p>If you decide to
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kick_the_tires">kick the tyres</a><sup>†</sup>,
please do let us know how it goes. There’s still work to do with
installing and packaging, but we think the API is in good shape. (I
did notice that if you call <code>compile_stylesheet()</code> and the stylesheet
isn’t well formed, the call silently returns <code>None</code> instead of raising
an error. I’ve
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/5781">reported that one</a>!)</p>

<p>I’ll probably check my email most days, but I can’t speak for
anyone else. Apologies if some of your feedback isn’t properly
addressed before the new year.</p>

<p>Once again, wishing you the happiest of holiday seasons!</p>
