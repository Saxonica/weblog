<h1>Triaging the bug lists…</h1>

<p>The very observant among you may have noticed me making a bunch of changes to
the
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/projects/saxon-js/issues">SaxonJS
issues list</a> this afternoon. We’ve started planning for SaxonJS 3.0 and we’ve made
a couple of early passes over the issues list.</p>

<p>Today, I tried to make the actual issues list reflect some of those
tentative plans. I’ve added “SaxonJS 3.0” as a milestone to a bunch of
issues and I’ve moved some of the priorities around.</p>

<p>Don’t read <em>too</em> much into that at the moment. For one
thing, there’s almost certainly too much on the list, for another
I expect we’ll do at least one more maintenance release of 2.x before we get to 3.0.
</p>

<p>But we have to start somewhere. Feedback welcome.</p>
