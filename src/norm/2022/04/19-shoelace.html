<h1>SaxonJS with web components</h1>

<p>I haven’t worked with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components">web components</a> very much,
though they’ve been on my “must explore more” list for a while. A couple of days ago,
I stumbled across <a href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace</a>, “a forward-thinking
library of web components.”</p>

<p>“That’d just work in SaxonJS, right?”, I asked myself.</p>

<p>Yep. I updated the
<a href="https://github.com/Saxonica/helloWorldJS">helloWorldJS</a> repository
that I created a while back to demonstrate it.</p>

<p>The new work is in the <code>shoelace</code> branch.</p>

<p>There’s not much different, really.</p>

<ol>
<li>The HTML file includes the
Shoelace scripts and styling from its CDN. (A more robust application
would want local copies, but this is just a toy.)</li>
<li>Instead of using a <code>button</code> element, we use the Shoelace
web-component: <code>&lt;sl-button>Click me&lt;/sl-button></code>.
</li>
<li>The match pattern for the onclick handler changes to
<code>match="sl-button"</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s pretty much all there is to it. Neat. I must try out some more web
components when I have a chance. In principle, the seem like a really good idea.</p>
