<h1>Oops, we did it again</h1>

<p>As some of you have noticed, the SaxonJS
“<a href="../../2023/10/06-no-longer-supported.html">no longer supported</a>” bug
returned a few days ago. I’d have sworn that I removed that warning when we shipped
SaxonJS 2.6. But I’d also have sworn we would get 3.0 out before now. Maybe I’m
not very good at swearing.</p>

<p>That warning <em>has been</em> removed from
<a href="../../../announcements/2024/10/saxonjs-2.7.html">SaxonJS 2.7</a>, so
this issue won’t surface again next October.</p>

<p>Apologies for not getting a maintenance release out sooner. We really should
have. Focus has been on SaxonJS 3.0, which is still coming along nicely, but
there were a number of bug fixes in SaxonJS 2.x that we could have shipped
months ago.</p>

<p>My expectation is that we’ll ship some sort of beta test version of SaxonJS
3.0 “real soon now” and Saxon 12.6 to fix
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6487">the SEF bug</a> in 12.5 shortly
before or after that.
