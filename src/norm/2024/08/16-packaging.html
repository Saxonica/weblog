<h1>Packaging SaxonJS for the browser</h1>

<p>Over the years, there have been several requests to improve the way that
SaxonJS is packaged for the browser. In the run up towards SaxonJS 3.0 (real
soon now, I promise), I’ve spent a few hours trying to see if that’s possible.</p>

<p>For SaxonJS on Node.js, things seem to be working the way users expect. You
can install SaxonJS, and <em>xslt3.js</em>, the command-line XSLT processor,
with <code>npm install</code>. Then you can use them as you would other Node.js
modules and applications.</p>

<p>For the browser, things are a little less clear.</p>

<p>I’ll start out by observing that SaxonJS is a large(ish) collection of mostly
plain JavaScript files. There are a mixture of techniques used, as you might
expect from a code base that stretches back seven or eight years (roughly ∞ in
JavaScript years). This code is compiled by the <a
href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">Closure Compiler</a> to
produce the release artifacts.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p><em>Aside:</em> Producing TypeScript instead of JavaScript is almost certainly
impractical. And
the answer to the question, “can you make it an ESM module?” appears to be “no”. But
maybe I’m wrong?</p>
</div>

<p>Almost anything is <em>possible</em> in software,
but there some things are probably <em>impractical</em> because of how SaxonJS
is built.
</p>

<p>What I’ve come to realize after several hours is that I
don’t actually understand what problem I’m trying to solve. That usually makes
problems harder.</p>

<p>For example, it would be easy to package the browser versions of the SaxonJS
libraries into the <code>saxon-js</code> <em>npm</em> package. That would allow
you to use <code>npm install</code> to install it. Once installed, you could
refer to it in HTML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="node_modules/saxon-js/SaxonJS3.rt.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>

<p>That’s a non-zero usability improvement over downloading the browser release
yourself and adding it to your project, but it’s an <em>awfully small</em>
improvement. So small, that I conjecture that the request to “put it in the npm
package” means more than that. But I don’t know what more.</p>

<p>Another request that’s come up a couple of times is whether we should provide
a version that’s been packaged up with <em>webpack</em>. Well. Okay. I spent
a bit of time on that and eventually I managed to get</p>

<pre><code>npx webpack --config webpack.config.js</code></pre>

<p>to take <code>src/SaxonJS3.js</code>, chew on it for a while, and produce
<code>dist/SaxonJS3.js</code>. That was a little, uh, underwhelming. I started
with a JavaScript library that I could load in the browser and ended with…a
different one, I guess?</p>

<p>Then there are suggestions that instead of <em>webpack</em> I should be
trying <em>vite</em> or <em>bun</em> or something else and do I also need
<em>browserify</em>? I don’t know.
I’m about to give up, at least in the short term, but before I do, I thought
I’d see if anyone out there can tell me what I’m missing.</p>

<p>If you would like to see SaxonJS for the browser packaged up in some
different way, can you tell me how? And why? A small test case would be ideal:
something that isn’t too complicated, that doesn’t work with SaxonJS as it’s
distributed today, that would work if we packaged it in some other way.</p>
