<h1>New infrastructure…</h1>

<p>Just FYI, we’ve moved some things around. Some of our web
infrastructure, the way
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/">www.saxonica.com</a>
and
<a href="https://dev.saxonica.com/">dev.saxonica.com</a>
are served, for example, has changed.
Plus we have some new infrastructure for
<a href="https://downloads.saxonica.com/">downloads</a>
and 
<a href="https://maven.saxonica.com/">Maven</a>.
</p>

<p>You aren’t supposed to notice. Or, at least, it isn’t supposed to
be broken. There are redirects in place for things we know moved and
a few very old things have fallen by the wayside.</p>

<p>If you see something that you think is broken, please tell us!</p>
