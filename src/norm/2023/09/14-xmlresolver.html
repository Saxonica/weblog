<h1>XML Resolver 6.x SNAPSHOT</h1>

<p>Under the hood, Saxon uses a “resolver” whenever it
attempts to load a document (a source document, stylesheet module,
unparsed text document, etc.). For the past few releases, the Java,
C#, and C products have been using resolvers based on the
<a href="https://xmlresolver.org/">XML Resolver APIs</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on some improvements to those APIs. It’s likely
that the next releases of Saxon will be ship with XML Resolver
6.x.</p>

<p>If you’d like to
<a href="https://xmlresolver.org/6x-snapshot/">preview the planned changes</a>
and provide feedback about how they work in your applications, that’d
be grand.</p>
