<h1>Brand new weblog, just like the old weblog</h1>

<p>As part of some infrastructure cleanup, we decided to change how
the weblog is managed. Itâ€™s now hosted on
<a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/">blog.saxonica.com</a>.</p>

<p>All of the old posts have been copied over and redirects are in
place. Along the way, I cleaned up a few broken links.</p>

<p>If anything seems broken, please do let me know!</p>
