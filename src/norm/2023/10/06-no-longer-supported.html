<h1>SaxonJS 2.5 ** NO LONGER SUPPORTED **</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TL;DR</a>, you can
ignore the message.</p>

<p>Several folks have noticed that, since about yesterday, if you run
the SaxonJS 2.5 <code>xslt3</code> Node.js command line processor, it
prints a scary “no longer supported” message.</p>

<p>Sorry. Our bad. The message is only informative and has no effect
on the performance of the processor.</p>

<p>We support SaxonJS releases for at least a year and a while back
(far enough back that I can’t easily determine when from the
repository history), we confidently assumed that we’d always do a
release at least once a year. So when you got that message, it was to
encourage you to upgrade.</p>

<p>Except this year, we published a whole bunch of other releases,
embarked on SaxonJS 3.0, shifted our web infrastructure around, and
did a bunch of other things. What we didn’t do was publish SaxonJS 3.0
within a year, and because we were heads-down on that, we didn’t
notice that we hadn’t published a SaxonJS 2.6 release within a year
either.</p>

<p>(It’s all a little embarrassing.)</p>

<p>We’ve fixed a handful of bugs in SaxonJS 2.5 since we shipped it,
and we’ve identified a slightly larger handful that we’d like to
consider fixing before we ship a SaxonJS 2.6 release. But we will ship
it, as quickly as practical.</p>
