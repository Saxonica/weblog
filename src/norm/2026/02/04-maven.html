<h1>Maven repository</h1>

<p>I’ve posted about our Maven repository
<a href="/norm/2020/10/29-maven.html">before</a> (and
<a href="/norm/2020/10/02-maven.html">before that</a>).
It’s where we publish our commercial products, Saxon PE and Saxon EE, accessible
via Maven. It’s moved since we first announced it, it’s now at
<a href="https://maven.saxonica.com/">https://maven.saxonica.com</a>.</p>

<p>You can use it by configuring your build system to include our
repository. For example, in a Kotlin Gradle build script, like this:</p>

<pre><code>repositories {
    maven { url = uri("https://maven.saxonica.com/maven") }
}</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use Maven coordinates to get the libraries. For example, like
this:</p>

<pre><code>dependencies {
  implementation("com.saxonica:Saxon-EE:12.9")
}</code></pre>

<p>It’s been running without incident for just over five years now, so I think
we can stop calling it experimental. It wasn’t clear when we first put it up if
just hosting it on some static web pages would be sufficient. It appears to be.
I’m confident that whatever benefits we’d see from running an actual artifact
repository system would be outweighed by the complexity of doing so.</p>

<p>Our open source product, Saxon HE, is published in our repository for
completeness, but it’s also available as usual through
<a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.sf.saxon/Saxon-HE">Maven Central</a>.</p>
