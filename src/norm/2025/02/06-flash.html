<p>Saxonica was incorporated twenty-one years ago, in February 2004. To
celebrate, we‚Äôre having a flash sale. For one weekend only, a Saxon license
is just <span title="Base 2 is just like base 10‚Ä¶ if you're missing 8 fingers">¬£101.01</span>!<sup><a class="tandclink" href="#tandc">*</a></sup></p>

<p>A lot has changed since Michael Kay founded Saxonica. Our flagship Java
product has been joined by C, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP, and Python products.
We‚Äôre now delivering applications and tools for three platforms across five
architectures. Our team has grown, and our business has evolved. But what hasn‚Äôt
changed is our dedication to being an industry-leading provider of XML
technologies.</p>

<p>The sale runs Friday evening (8 February 2025) through Monday morning, UK
time. With a savings of almost 75% off our regular price, this is your perfect
opportunity to hop aboard and join us for the next 21 years!</p>

<p id="tandc" class="fineprint"><sup>*</sup> Terms and conditions apply üòÅ:
limited to one single-user EE license purchased through our online shop.</p>
