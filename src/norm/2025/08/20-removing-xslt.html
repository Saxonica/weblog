<h1>Removing XSLT from the browser</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> recently proposed to “remove
XSLT from the web platform”. This is not the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zIg2KC7PyH0">first attempt</a>.
There’s a long discussion thread on the GitHub issue for the
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523 ">current proposal</a>,
including a lot of pushback. The same is true of the
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11563">related issue</a>
to “remove mentions of XSLT from the html[sic] spec”.</p>

<p>Whether the current attempt to deprecate XSLT in the browser succeeds, or
whether feedback from users will be sufficient to discourage them again, I don’t
know. Regardless of the outcome, it's clear that we are heading closer and
closer to a monoculture in web browsers.</p>

<p>Deprecating XSLT will break a lot of web pages. Thousands of Saxonica's pages,
and perhaps tens of thousands of others. It will break web pages that have been
quietly and usefully referenced by an unknown number of users for a couple of
decades. It will break web pages that are immutable, that are not, or can no
longer be, maintained because the projects have ended or the authors have died.
Things will be forever lost because tens of thousands of pages aren’t enough.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are technical arguments in favor of removing XSLT from the
browser, including arguments about code complexity or security. And I’m sure
there are economic arguments about the importance of investing resources where
they matter most, or at least in places offering the best return on investment.
None of these arguments show consideration for the health of the web as a
reliable, open set of technologies which can be easily used by individuals and
large corporations alike.</p>

<p>Of course, building web applications with XSLT 1.0 is a considerable challenge.
This is probably the main reason why most publishers delivering complex XML
documents have continued to use XSLT on the server, where the technology is
constantly refreshed, rather than sticking with a stagnant 25-year-old
client-side implementation. Many XSLT users would happily switch to using
client-side transformation if it were actively supported by the browser vendors,
including support for later versions of the standard, which offer much higher
productivity.</p>

<p>Saxonica publishes world-class implementations of XSLT for Java, C#, C, C++,
Python, and JavaScript. Our JavaScript implementation runs both in the browser
and on NodeJS. We support the current, modern standards and we’re actively
involved in developing those standards for the future. XSLT is the most
cost-effective solution for a wide range of practical use cases, and the size
and breadth of Saxonica's user base reflects this fact.</p>

<p>XSLT will continue to survive, and thrive, even if the WHATWG insists on
depriving web developers and users of the many advantages modern XSLT would
offer them.</p>
