<h1>Preparing for Saxon 13</h1>

<p>We’ve made a couple of Saxon 12 releases where we (once intentionally, once
accidentally) built the Java release without support for JDK 8. Users
noticed.</p>

<p>We’re starting to think about Saxon 13 and we’re definitely planning to move
the minimum Java version forward. There are still a few years left in JDK 8
extended service support, but our build tools are beginning to issue deprecation
warnings for it.</p>

<p>JDK 8 was released more than a decade ago. There have been a lot of Java
language improvements in the intervening years and we’re starting to take
advantage of some of them.</p>

<p>It makes sense to choose a “long term service” (LTS) release. We’ll want to
avoid changing the version during maintenance releases. The <a
href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html">Java
LTS releases</a> are 11, 17, 21, and 25. Premier support for 11 has already
ended and version 25 was only released last month, that’s probably too
aggressive.</p>

<p>That leaves 17 or 21. We’re leaning towards Java 17, but we’d welcome any
thoughts you might have.</p>
