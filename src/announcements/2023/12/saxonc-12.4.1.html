<h1>Announcing SaxonC 12.4.1!</h1>

<p>A SaxonC 12.4.1 maintenance release has been published. This
release fixes <a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6268">a build
error</a> on the Windows platform and includes one additional
patch.</p>

<p>I’m an ardent believer in build automation and reproducibility
through scripting. We’ve made a lot of progress in this area, but
Windows is still a bit “hands on.” Problem is, it was my hands and I
messed up.</p>

<p>A while back, we considered upgrading to a newer version of
GraalVM. In the course of testing that, I upgraded the version on the
Windows build machine. But ultimately, we decided not to make that
upgrade.</p>

<p>Despite having an explicit note in my release checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>☑ Check the version of GraalVM</li>
</ul>

<p>I missed it on the Windows box. A lot of good detective work went
into trying to figure out what was going on, but in the end, just
building with the “right” version of GraalVM fixed it. Apologies to
the team and everyone else for that.</p>

<p>The 12.4.1 release also includes a
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6182">partial fix</a> for
issues relating to UTF-8 string-based C API functions. Unfortunately,
a more complete fix was deemed too risky for what was otherwise an
“emergency” release. That fix will have to wait for next time.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of what’s new in 12.4, please see the original
<a href="../11/saxon-12.4.html">release announcement</a>.</p>
