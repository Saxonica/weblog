<h1>Saxon 11.7 and 12.8</h1>

<p>The accompanying release announcements for
<a href="saxon-11.7.html">Saxon 11.7</a> and
<a href="saxon-12.8.html">Saxon 12.8</a> describe those
releases in detail. This post summarizes why we decided that we
needed to release them both this week.</p>

<p>Some applications are known to use Saxon to run untrusted, user-submitted
stylesheets or queries. Running untrusted code always entails some risk. Saxon
provides two
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!configuration/config-features">features</a>
designed to help mitigate this risk: <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> and

<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code>. Setting <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code>
can limit what resources a stylesheet or query can access; it can for example,
forbid access to file: URIs. The <code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature
can disable access to reflexive Java extension functions, some system
properties, and some other extension functions. (The remit of the
<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature is a little wider than you might
expect.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we discovered a function in Saxon 11 and 12 that was not
adequately controlled by these features. In principle, a stylesheet or query
running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE could access the local filesystem even if the
<code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> feature was set to forbid such access. The risk
is small: it only applies to untrusted code running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE (it
does not apply to Saxon-HE) on a system where reading from the local filesystem
would be deemed a risk. (We would encourage anyone running untrusted code to use
a sandboxed environment where there is no data on the filesystem that needs to
be protected from read access.)</p>

<p>Although we judge the risk to be small, At Saxonica, we take security
seriously and we are publishing maintenance releases of Saxon 11 and Saxon 12 to
close this gap. We urge anyone running untrusted stylesheets or queries under
Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE to move to version 11.7 or 12.8 immediately.</p>

<p>This bug is present in the Java, C#, C, C++, Python and PHP products. It is
not present in Saxon 10 (including the Saxon.NET 10) or in earlier releases. It
is not present in SaxonJS.</p>
