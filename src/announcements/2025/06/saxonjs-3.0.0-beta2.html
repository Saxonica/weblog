<h1>Announcing SaxonJS-HE 3.0.0-beta2!</h1>

<p>SaxonJS 3.0 is a major update to the SaxonJS product. In June 2025, we are
publishing a second preview release, version 3.0.0-beta2. This is a preview
release of the SaxonJS 3.0 HE (Home Edition) product. An EE (Enterprise Edition)
product is in the works.
</p>

<div>
<h2>New features in the beta2 release</h2>

<p>This release includes a few bug fixes from the first beta.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/5923">5923</a>
   Provide a way to control event listener parameters</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6599">6599</a>
   Sequence interacts badly with try/catch</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6697">6697</a>
   Checksum checking in SaxonJS 3</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6742">6742</a>
   Untethered promises with SaxonJS 3.0.0-beta1</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the most consequential is probably 6697. In the course of fixing a
bug related to SEF files produced for SaxonJS 2, we introduced a bug where
SaxonJ 12.6 couldn’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta1! That’s been fixed.
You can now produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with Saxon 12.6 or later.
(Unfortunately, you can’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with SaxonJ
12.5 or earlier!)
