      <h1>Java Generics revisited</h1>
      <p>In Saxon 9.9 we took considerable pains to adopt Java Generics for processing sequences:
         in particular the Sequence and SequenceIterator classes, and all their subclasses,
         became Sequence&lt;? extends Item&gt; and SequenceIterator&lt;? extends Item&gt;.
         </p>
      <p>
         I'm now coming to the conclusion that this was a mistake; or at any rate, that we
         went too far.
         </p>
      <p>
         What exactly are the benefits of using Generics? It's supposed to improve type safety
         and reduce the need for casts which, if applied incorrectly, can trigger run-time
         exceptions. So it's all about detecting more of your errors at compile time.
         </p>
      <p>
         Well, I don't think we've been seeing those benefits. And the main reason for that
         is that in most cases, when we're processing sequences, we don't have any static knowledge
         of the kind of items we are dealing with.
         </p>
      <p>
         Sure, when we process a particular XPath path expression, we know whether it's going
         to deliver nodes or atomic values. But when we write the Java code in Saxon to handle
         path expressions, all we know is that the result will always be a sequence of items.
         </p>
      <p>
         There are some cases where particular kinds of expression only handle nodes, or only
         handle atomic values. For example, the input sequences for a union operator will always
         be sequences of nodes. It would be nice if we didn't have to handle a completely general
         sequence and cast every item to class NodeInfo. But it's an illusion to think we can
         get extra type safety that way. The operands of a union are arbitrary expressions,
         and the iterators returned by the subexpressions are going to be arbitrary iterators;
         there's no way we can translate the type-safety we are implementing at the XPath level
         into type-safe evaluators at the Java level.
         </p>
      <p>
         It's particularly obvious that generics give us no type-safety at the API level. In
         s9api, <b>XPathSelector.evaluate()</b> returns an <b>XdmValue</b>. That's a lot better than the JAXP equivalent which just returns <b>Object</b>, but the programmer still has to do casting to convert the items in the return <b>XdmValue</b> to nodes, string, integers, or whatever. And there's no way we can change that; the
         XPath expression is supplied as a string at run-time, so it's only at run-time that
         we know what type of items it returns. If that's true at the API level, it's equally
         true internally. Any kind of expression can invoke any other kind of expression (that's
         what orthogonality in language design is about), which means that the interfaces between
         an expression and its subexpressions are always going to be general-purpose sequences
         whose item type is known only at execution time.
         </p>
      <p>
         There are a couple of aspects of Java Â generics that cause us real pain.
         </p>
      <p>
         
         
         
         <ul>
            <li>The first is the XDM rule that every item is itself a <b>Sequence</b>. So if <b>Sequence</b> is a generic type, parameterized by Item type, and <b>Item</b> is a subclass of <b>Sequence</b>, then <b>Item</b> has to be itself a generic type parameterized by its own type. Rather than <b>Item</b>, it has to be <b>Item&lt;? extends Item&gt;</b>; or perhaps it should be <b>Item&lt;? extends Item&lt;? extends Item&gt;&gt;</b>, and so ad infinitum. And then <b>StringValue</b> extends <b>Item&lt;StringValue&gt; </b>and so on. We found ways around that conundrum, but the complexity is horrendous;
               it certainly doesn't achieve the goal of making it easier to write correct code.</li>
            <li>The second is arrays. Arrays don't play at all well with generics; you can't create
               an array of a generic type, for example. And yet there are lots of places where it's
               useful to use arrays, and some where arrays are the only option. VarArgs functions,
               for example, present their arguments as an array. In some cases we wanted to carry
               on using arrays (rather than lists) for compatibility, in other cases we want to use
               them for convenience or for performance. The natural signature for a function call,
               for example is <b>public Sequence call(Context context, Sequence[] args)</b>. There's no way we can refine this in a way that passes static information about
               the argument types from the caller to the callee, because we're using the same Java
               signature for all XPath functions.</li>
         </ul>
         But having got Generics working, at great effort, in 9.9, should we retain them or
         drop them?
         
         </p>
      <p>
         One reason I'm motivated to drop them is .NET. We have a significant user base on
         .NET, but we have something of a potential crisis looming in terms of ongoing support
         for this platform. Microsoft appear to be basing their future strategy around .NET
         Core, allowing .NET Framework to fade away into the sunset. But the technology we
         use for bridging to .NET, namely IKVM, only supports .NET Framework and not .NET Core;
         and Jeroen Frijters who single-handedly developed IKVM and supported it for umpteen
         years (with no revenue stream to support it) has thrown in the towel and is no longer
         taking it forward. So we're looking at a number of options for a way forward on .NET.
         One of these is source code conversion; and to make source code conversion viable
         without forking the code, we need to minimise our dependencies on Java features that
         don't translate easily to C#. Notable among those features is generics.
         </p>
      <p>
         In the short term, I think I'm going to roll back the use of generics in selected
         areas where they are clearly more trouble than they are worth. That's particularly
         true of <b>Sequence</b> and its subclasses, including <b>Item</b>. For <b>SequenceIterator</b> it's probably worth keeping generics for the time being, but we'll keep that under
         review.
