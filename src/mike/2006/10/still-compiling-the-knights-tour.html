      <h1>Still Compiling the Knight's Tour</h1>
      <p>I wrote on 20 September that I was getting the compiled Knight's Tour stylesheet to
         run in 39.3 ms, compared with 45.9 ms for the interpreted code, and that I didn't
         think it would be hard to improve on this. Well, it's now down to 9.41 ms. (Thie compares
         with the figure of 900 ms given in my book, for an earlier version of Saxon and a
         previous laptop.) But a lot depends on what you mean by "hard".</p>
      <p>One of the difficulties is simply getting reproducible performance results. I got
         figures around the 9.5 ms mark 20 minutes ago, but when I run the same code now, I'm
         getting 18 ms. I really need a dedicated machine that isn't polling for email, checking
         for viruses, and changing its CPU speed because it's getting too hot, all at unpredictable
         times. I miss the old ICL mainframes where you could get an accurate and reproducible
         count of the actual number of instructions executed.</p>
      <p>Another of the difficulties is that things that should improve the performance don't
         always succeed. It's conventional wisdom that lazy evaluation improves performance
         of functional programs: well, I implemented it, and the performance of this query
         got worse. But that doesn't mean you can throw away the conventional wisdom and decide
         it's not worth doing. It may be that the query you're currently profiling is exceptional;
         or it might be that the facility is needed to avoid pathological worst-case performance
         even though it actually decreases average performance. One of the main benefits of
         lazy evaluation is perhaps in memory usage, and savings in memory usage don't help
         performance unless you're short of memory. Alternatively, it's possible that performance
         didn't get worse with lazy evaluation at all, and I was simply seeing a measurement
         glitch.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, just occasionally, you get a big improvement from a small change, and you
         know it's sound. I found that the code for building a sequence was doing an item-by-item
         copy from a list to an array, and I got the elapsed time down from 19 ms to 9.5 just
         by changing that to use List.toArray(). Perhaps the figures aren't right and perhaps
         they won't benefit everyone that much, but it's definitely worth doing, and (like
         a number of changes I've made in this exercise) it benefits the interpreted code as
         well as the compiled code.</p>
      <p>Saxon has several ways of executing a given expression, and compilation is adding
         to the range of choices in most areas, though it does mean that the choice always
         has to be made at compile time. The choices include pull and push mode, eager versus
         lazy evaluation, saving results in memory versus re-evaluating them when needed. What's
         difficult now is to come up with criteria for choosing one strategy rather than another.
         Sometimes it makes very little difference; sometimes it makes a big difference, but
         it's hard to establish the factors in favour of one approach rather than another.
         It's all very empirical at the moment, and needs a much better analytical model of
         what's going on: where the costs are, and what the costs depend on. I'm some way yet
         from having that level of understanding of cause and effect, which is frustrating.
         Meanwhile, though, even if it's empirical, the numbers are getting inexorably better
         all the time.</p>
      <p>Queries like the Knight's Tour and the 8-Queens are probably among those that will
         show the greatest benefit from compilation, because they are computation-intensive
         rather than data-intensive. Many more typical queries and stylesheets spend a lot
         of their time down in the TinyTree code navigating the input document, or in the output
         pipeline serializing the result tree, and these aren't going to benefit so much. But
         I'm becoming reasonably confident that there'll be a worthwhile benefit across the
         board. Currently I'm compiling about half the constructs that the front-end expression
         processor generates, which is enough to process about 95% of all queries (XQuery is
         a smaller language than XSLT so I'm doing it first). Doing the other 50% is going
         to be rather tedious work. Testing isn't easy, if only because vast chunks of the
         XQTS test suite contain constant expressions that can be evaluated statically, long
         before the Java code generator gets anywhere near them. I think I'm going to have
         to find some way of switching off the early evaluation of such expressions, just for
         test purposes.</p>
