      <h1>Choosing Java class names</h1>
      <p>Years ago, I took some childish pleasure in naming the class that
         does whitespace-stripping in Saxon "Stripper.java".</p>
      <p>Guess what? The second-most popular entry point to the Saxonica web site from Google
         is <span>.../javadoc/net/sf/saxon/event/stripper.html</span></p>
      <p>The punters must be very disappointed. I wonder how much I'm paying for the wasted
         bandwidth?</p>
      <p>It's one way to boost my google rankings, I suppose.</p>
