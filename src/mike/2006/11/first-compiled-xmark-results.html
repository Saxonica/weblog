      <h1>First compiled XMark results</h1>
      <p>The code to compile XQuery into Java has now advanced sufficiently that I can run
         all the XMark benchmark queries, producing correct results, and reproducing the Saxon-SA
         join optimizations. First results are shown below: there's clearly room for further
         work in some areas, but overall it's an encouraging milestone. All timings in milliseconds,
         to run the query on a 12Mb data file</p>

      <p>These figures are very preliminary. With some of them there's very little scope for
         further improvement (the compiled code for count(/a/b/c/) is about as good as it's
         going to get, and the only way to make further improvements is for the compiler to
         penetrate deeper than the object model and serialization interfaces that the compiled
         code currently invokes. But there's no reason why any of the figures for compiled
         code should be slower than the interpreted figures. The results for Q8 and Q9 are
         the most encouraging, because these rely very heavily on optimization. In fact it's
         generally true that the more complex the query, the bigger the potential gains.</p>
      <p>There are a couple of outliers here. Q19 is the only query in XMark that does sorting,
         and that's clearly an area that needs attention. Q6 and Q7 are both dominated by a
         count(). Q10, 11, and 12 are probably dominated by conversion of untyped values to
         typed values in filter predicates (the XMark benchmark is schemaless, which makes
         it very frustrating to work with at times, because there would be so many ways of
         speeding it up if source changes to the queries were allowed!)</p>
      <p>I'll come back with progress reports as these numbers improve. I don't expect to achieve
         the same kind of speed-up as with the Knight's Tour (a factor of 7) because with these
         queries, far more of the time is spent in reading the input data, and there's a limit
         to how fast that can go. A factor of 2 for the more complex queries remains a reasonable
         goal.</p>
      <p>It's worth noting that all these figures are very competitive with those reported
         by other vendors. Compare with the 11Mb database results at <a href="http://monetdb.cwi.nl/XQuery/Overview/Benchmark/XMark/">http://monetdb.cwi.nl/XQuery/Overview/Benchmark/XMark/</a> - the Q9 figure, for example, is 1000 times better than two of the competitive systems
         cited.</p>
