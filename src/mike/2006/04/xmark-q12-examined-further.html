      <h1>XMark Q12 examined further</h1>
      <p><span>In yesterday's posting, I showed some figures demonstrating that for most queries,
            Saxon-B and Saxon-SA have very similar performance, but for some join queries, Saxon-SA
            performs dramatically better. However, I left with some unexplained results for the
            XMark query Q12. In this posting I'll explore this query in a little more detail.
            I don't know if we'll come to any conclusions, but at the very least it's an opportunity
            to explain how to use Saxon's "explain" output, which shows the structure of the compiled
            expression tree, that is, the query execution plan chosen by the optimizer. You can
            get this diagnostic output for XQuery using the -e option on the command line, or
            for XSLT using saxon:explain="yes" typically on an xsl:template or xsl:function declaration.</span></p>
      <p><span>Q12 reads like this:</span></p>
      <pre><code>for $p in /site/people/person
let $l := for $i in /site/open_auctions/open_auction/initial
          where $p/profile/@income &gt; (5000 * $i)
          return $i
where  $p/profile/@income &gt; 50000
return &lt;items person="{$p/name}"&gt;{ count ($l) }&lt;/items&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>The explain output is shown below, with comments interspersed.</p>
      <pre><code>for $p in
  path /
    path /
      path /
        /
        child::element(site)
      child::element(people)
    child::element(person)</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">This is a very direct translation of the
         first "for" clause, the optimizer has done nothing clever. It's a
         bit tricky to read, because the expression has effectively been
         rewritten in "reverse Polish" order. But you should be able to
         make sense of it.</p>
      <pre><code>return
  if (
    some $qq:13419912 in
      treat as xdt:_numeric_
        convert untyped atomic items to xdt:_numeric_
          atomize
            path /
              path /
                $p
                child::element(profile)
              attribute::attribute(income)
    satisfies
      operator gt
        $qq:13419912
        50000</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">This part is the "where" clause associated
         with the outer FLOWR expression. I'm slightly suprised that this
         clause wasn't turned into a filter expression, but in this case
         that wouldn't have given any benefit, so it's nothing to worry
         about. The "where" is being turned into a simple conditional
         expression testing every item returned by the "for". If you look
         ahead in the output you'll see that the "else" branch of the
         conditional is "else ()" - when the condition is true, some
         output is produced, otherwise nothing is produced.</p>
      <p class="comment">The original condition <code>$p/profile/@income &gt; 50000</code>
         has first been turned into the expression
         <code>some $qqq in $p/profile/@income satisfies $qqq gt 50000</code>.
         This will test each selected @income in turn against the value
         50000, and exit as soon as one is found that satisfies the
         condition. Of course, without a schema, the XQuery compiler
         cannot know that each person ($p) has only one profile and
         therefore only one income.</p>
      <p class="comment">The other changes here implement the type-checking and
         type-conversion rules. Reading up the tree, the @income node is
         first atomized, to extract its typed value. The attribute could
         be list-valued, so the typed value has to be treated as a
         sequence. The next operation (convert) converts any untypedAtomic
         values in this sequence to xs:double values, leaving other values
         unchanged (it uses the internal type name xdt:_numeric_ in the
         output, but it's actually converting to doubles). Then in
         the "treat" operation it checks that all the values in the
         resulting sequence (including any values that weren't untyped and
         therefore haven't been converted) are now numeric, and raises an
         error if this check fails. (Actually, because these operations on
         sequences are pipelined, the error will only be raised if a
         non-numeric value is found <em>before</em> finding a value that's
         &gt; 50000).</p>
      <p class="comment">At this point we see a difference in the explain output if
         we've told Saxon that all nodes are untyped (using
         configuration.setAllNodesUntyped(true)). In this case the
         condition starts:</p>
      <pre><code>if (
  some $qq:20324370 in
    convert untyped atomic items to xdt:_numeric_
      atomize</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">Note the absence of the "treat" operator. This is because
         Saxon knows that the result of atomization will always be untyped
         atomic, and the result of the convert operator will therefore be
         numeric, so testing the values to check that they are numeric is
         superfluous. This is the reason that Saxon-B sometimes has a tiny
         edge over Saxon-SA when handling untyped data.</p>
      <p class="comment">The "then" part of the conditional represents the "let"
         and "return" clauses of the outer FLWOR expression. It starts
         like this:</p>
      <pre><code>    let $l[refCount=1] :=
      let $zz:18929195[refCount=10] :=
        lazy
          atomize
            path /
              path /
                $p
                child::element(profile)
              attribute::attribute(income)
      return</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">The [refcount=1] is an indication of how many references to a
         variable there are (with a reference from inside a loop counting
         as "many"). You'll never see zero, because if there are no
         references, the expression gets optimized away. The only real
         distinction is between one and many (represented here by a
         nominal value of 10). The difference is that if there's only one
         reference, then evaluation of the variable and the expression
         that uses it can be pipelined together, with no memory allocated
         to storage of the variable's value. The refcount is also used
         when deciding whether to create an index for the variable.</p>
      <p class="comment">The operator "lazy" means "evaluate this expression the first
         time its value is needed". When an expression is pulled out of a
         loop, it is always prefixed by this operator to ensure that in
         cases where the loop is evaluated zero times, the extracted
         expression isn't evaluated. The main reason for this is to avoid
         spurious errors occurring for expressions like <code>for $x in
            $sequence return $x + 23 div count($sequence)</code>.</p>
      <p class="comment">The outer "let" here is for the user-defined variable $l;
         the inner let is a system-allocated variable, which has been
         created because the optimizer has recognized that the expression
         <code>$p/profile/@income</code> doesn't depend on the value of
         $i, and can therefore be pulled out of the inner "for" loop.
         Atomization of the value (to extract the typed value of the
         @income attribute) also happens outside the loop. (Saxon doesn't
         however recognize that this expression appears twice in the
         query.)</p>
      <p class="comment">The value of $l is computed by the next subexpression:</p>
      <pre><code>      return
        path /
          /
          filter []
            path /
              path /
                path /
                  child::element(site)
                  child::element(open_auctions)
                child::element(open_auction)
              child::element(initial)
            operator many-to-many &gt;
              $zz:18929195
              operator *
                5000
                atomize singleton
                  .</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">This time the "where" clause has been turned into a filter
         expression (represented by the operator "filter []". The
         expression being filtered is the path expression
         site/open_auctions/open_auction/initial, and the filter is [$zz
         &gt; 5000*.], where $zz is the system-allocated variable we saw
         earlier. Notice how the variable $i has disappeared and has been
         replaced by a reference to the context item "." within the
         predicate.</p>
      <p class="comment">In this section of the query we see the main difference that
         occurs when we set the allNodesUntyped() option. In that case,
         firstly, after atomizing the value of @income outside the loop,
         the value is converted to an xs:double with the operator</p>
      <pre><code>convert untyped atomic items to xdt:_numeric_</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">Secondly, the use of "operator many-to-many &gt;" is replaced by</p>
      <pre><code>            let $zz:13419912[refCount=10] :=
              lazy
                operator *
                  5000
                  atomize
                    .
            return
              some $qq:8106640 in
                $zz:29131495
              satisfies
                operator gt
                  $qq:8106640
                  $zz:13419912</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">That is, the expression <code>[$zz &gt; 5000 * .]</code> has been rewritten as
         <code>[let $zz2 := (5000 * .) return some $qq in $zz satisfies $qq gt $zz2]</code>.</p>
      <p class="comment">It seems that this rewrite, in this particular case, is an unwise
         one. It's possible because in this case we have more information,
         for example we know that the typed value of @income will always
         be a single value, never a sequence, and as a result we don't
         need to use the potentially very expensive "many to many &gt;"
         operator which tests every item on the left against every item on
         the right. But the actual performance results show that in this
         particular case, where in fact every person has only one income
         though we had no way of knowing this in advance, the "many to
         many &gt;" operator actually performed better.</p>
      <p class="comment">The final part of the explain output, for completeness,
         represents the "return" clause of the outer FLWOR expression:</p>
      <pre><code>
    return
      element 
        name items
        content
            attribute 
              name person
              function string-join
                convert items to xs:string
                  atomize
                    path /
                      $p
                      child::element(name)
                                    " "
            function count
              $l</code></pre>
      <p class="comment">Notice again how Saxon, without the benefit of a schema, has
         no idea that a person has only one name. So the code
         person={$p/name} translates into a call on string-join() to
         output all the values of $p/name, separated by spaces.</p>
      <p>What can we conclude so far? We've learned that for this
         particular query, telling Saxon that all the nodes were untyped
         had the opposite effect from that intended: it enabled Saxon to
         perform an optimization which in this particular case was
         counter-productive.</p>
      <p>This doesn't actually help with our original question: why,
         unlike the vast majority of the queries in this benchmark, does
         Saxon-B achieve better results that Saxon-SA? It's not a big
         difference, but it needs explaining. It turns out that
         the "explain" output for Saxon-B is identical to the "explain"
         output for Saxon-SA with the "all nodes untyped" option, so it
         seems that there's something different happening at run-time.
         Sorry to leave you with an unsolved mystery, but I don't yet know
         what causing this!</p>
