      <h1>Push and Pull parsing</h1>
      <p>Saxon has supported the StAX interface for pull parsing for a while now, but I've
         seen little evidence that people are using it; and in fact generally the scene seems
         to have gone rather quiet. There's talk that a future JAXP release will require support
         for StAX as well as SAX input, and on .NET the standard System.Xml parser is a pull
         parser, so I thought I'd take a look at relative performance - perhaps the time might
         even come when it's appropriate to use a StAX parser as the default.</p>
      <p>I wrote a little program to build a Saxon tree using various parsers: two pull and
         two push. These were the results, all timings in milliseconds:</p>
      <pre><code>Input size (Mb)    Xerces  Piccolo  SJSXP  Woodstox
     6.8    1200     1320    1270     1030
    14.0    2400     2670    2640     2033</code></pre>
      <p>Xerces and Piccolo are SAX (push) parsers; SJSXP and Woodstox are StAX (pull) parsers.
         So there's certainly no reason from these figures (or from any other considerations
         really) to believe that pull is intrinsically faster than push. But it's interesting
         (a) that Woodstock does appear to have a demonstrable edge (20%) on all the others
         at least on this sample -- one would have to test a variety of other XML documents
         to be sure that it's sustainable, and (b) that Piccolo doesn't beat Xerces in this
         test, though they claim to be twice as fast in other tests.</p>
      <p>I'm not recommending that everyone switches over immediately to Woodstox - as often
         happens, they seem to have achieved some of the speed by taking short cuts on conformance,
         especially checking the detailed rules for valid names and valid characters. But if
         the 20% matters to you and you know the XML is valid already, it may be worth considering.</p>
