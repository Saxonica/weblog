      <h1>Streaming Mode on large documents</h1>
      <p>Coincidentally, the day after my successful efforts to get the XStream benchmark running
         using the Saxon-SA <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/serial.html">streaming mode for large documents</a>, (see previous post) a Saxon-SA customer sent me a problem: they needed to transform
         a 450 Mb file and wanted to know whether this facility would crack the problem. The
         answer, sadly, was no: the optimization only works if the transformation can be broken
         up into a sequence of transformations on subtrees of the document. In this particular
         use case the subtrees to be transformed carried context with them, for example they
         were grouped hierarchically, so the method doesn't work.</p>
      <p>As always, though, some new customer requirements proved a useful stimulus to improving
         the product. I haven't cracked this use case yet, but I have made some useful improvements.</p>
      <p>Firstly, you can now specify a filter on the expression defining the subtrees to be
         transformed, for example</p>
      <p>&lt;xsl:copy-of select="doc('huge.xml')//item[@price gt 50.00]"/&gt;</p>
      <p>The only restrictions on the filter are that it mustn't be positional, and it can't
         look outside the subtree being copied.</p>
      <p>Secondly, union expressions now work (this is a bug fix).</p>
      <p>Finally, the construct is now decoupled from the push-pull multithreading implementation.
         If all you want to do is to write selected parts of the large document to the serializer,
         or to a temporary tree held in a variable, then there is no push-pull conflict, and
         the whole thing can operate in push mode, filtering and all. On the other hand, if
         your stylesheet iterates over the sequence returned by the xsl:copy-of, then the multithreaded
         implementation is still used (this slows things down by about a factor of two, but
         that's often worth it for the memory savings.)</p>
