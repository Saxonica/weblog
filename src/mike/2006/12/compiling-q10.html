      <h1>Compiling Q10</h1>
      <p>
         
         The last remaining query in the XMark benchmark where the compiled code was running
         significantly slower than the interpreted code was Q10. This query is along the lines:</p>
      <p>for $i in distinct-values(<br />          /site/people/person/profile/interest/@category)<br />let $p := for    $t in /site/people/person<br />          where  $t/profile/interest/@category = $i<br />            return &lt;personne&gt;<br />                &lt;statistiques&gt;<br />                        &lt;sexe&gt;{ $t/profile/gender }&lt;/sexe&gt;,<br />                        &lt;age&gt;{ $t/profile/age }&lt;/age&gt;,<br />                        &lt;education&gt;{ $t/profile/education}&lt;/education&gt;,<br />                        &lt;revenu&gt;{ $t/profile/@income } &lt;/revenu&gt;<br />                &lt;/statistiques&gt;<br />                &lt;otherStuff&gt;................&lt;/otherStuff&gt;<br />              &lt;/personne&gt;<br />return &lt;categorie&gt;<br />        &lt;id&gt;{ $i }&lt;/id&gt;<br />        { $p }<br />      &lt;/categorie&gt;</p>
      <p>It turned out that the interpreted code was writing all the constructed elements directly
         to the result stream, whereas the compiled code was constructing an intermediate tree
         representing the contents of variable $p, and then copying this to the result stream,
         which meant that the execution time was nearly doubled. The reason for this is that
         the interpreted code represents $p in a Closure object, essentially a value subject
         to lazy evaluation, and then makes a run-time decision whether to evaluate this in
         "pull" or "push" mode depending on how the value is actually used. The compiled code
         was always evaluating such variables in "pull" mode, leading to the unnecessary copy.</p>
      <p>I considered various solutions. One could reproduce the interpretive behaviour by
         allowing a compiled closure to be evaluated in either mode, still making a run-time
         decision; or one could make a decision based on compile-time analysis that the reference
         to $p occurs in a context where push evaluation is advantageous. Instead I decided
         to do something more radical, and rewrite the tree to expand the variable reference
         $p inline. This is something I've been meaning to do for a long time, but I was always
         a bit concerned about context dependencies: what if the reference to $p occurs somewhere
         where the context is different from the place where $p is declared? However, on checking
         the code, it seems that all the analysis to resolve this has already been done. Saxon
         is already making a compile-time decision to use a "non-memo-closure" for $p (one
         which evaluates the expression without remembering the result), and the conditions
         for that seem to be exactly the same as the conditions that allow inlining. Moreover,
         there's already a tree-rewriting operation that does variable inlining, which is used
         for a more restricted purpose. So I discovered to my great surprise that the code
         to inline $p was only an extra four lines!</p>
      <p>The effect on the performance of the interpreted code is an improvement from 167 to
         161ms - nothing dramatic, as one would expect, because all we've done is to eliminate
         the small overhead of remembering the variable definition and evaluating it on first
         use. For the compiled code, however, inlining eliminates the tree copy operation,
         and improves the performance from 301ms to 104ms.</p>
      <p>All the more complex queries are now showing a speed up (for compiled versus interpreted
         execution) of between 25% and 50%. That's good enough for a first release, although
         I hope to improve on it. I would hope that real user workloads will see higher figures:
         as the work on the Knight's Tour showed, much higher speed-up is possible in cases
         where there are lots of variables, function calls, and computation within the query.</p>
      <p>But before the code can be released there are still a lot of things missing. Mainly
         things that are missing from the test suites, like external Java functions, user-defined
         collations, and so on; and also a lot more work on the functions and expressions which
         are tested in XQTS only using constant expressions that can be evaluated at compile
         time. Plus a review of the hundreds of TODO statements scattered around the code.<br />

               <div class="commentBody">I'm trying to keep the Java code generation at a sufficient level of abstraction that
                  it shouldn't be too hard to generate C# instead. I haven't absolutely decided to go
                  that way though. Alternatives are Java -&gt; bytecode -&gt; IL via IKVMC, or direct generation
                  of bytecode/IL.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Congratulations on the speedup. I'd be interested to hear how you generate the code. <br />We're doing some code generation as well. We're using XSLT to generate Java from a
                  small XML 'language'. Works much better than out initial approach of using Java to
                  walk through a DOM and generate the code.<br />Then we use com.sun.tools.javac.Main.compile() to compile the generated java files.
                  It works, but it's a bit clumsy, since javac can only handle java files in the file
                  system, not Strings or something else in memory. Maybe the tools API in JDK 6 will
                  bring some improvements.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Yes, I've also found that doing the Java compile via the API is pretty kludgey. I'm
                  leaning towards simply writing the Java out to filestore, and leaving the user to
                  add the Java compile stage - it works much better that way when there's a raft of
                  queries to compile en bloc. The kludginess of the compiler API seems to be the main
                  reason that going straight to bytecode would be beneficial.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Thanks for the reply. Just to make sure I understand - do you mean the new javax.tools
                  API http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/tools/package-summary.html or Main.compile()?
                  I just looked over the new API. I seems that it allows to somehow compile Java files
                  from strings, but I'm not looking forward to implementing JavaFileManager. It would
                  take me a while to thoroughly understand all these interfaces, enums, etc. So in the
                  end it's almost as bad as Main.compile(). :-)</div>

               <div class="commentBody">I believe that the compilation approach could allow the creation of compiled XSLT
                  "function libraries" -- modules to be easily distributed, deployed and re-used by
                  different transformations.<br />Do you think this would be possible to achieve in a future Saxon version?</div>
