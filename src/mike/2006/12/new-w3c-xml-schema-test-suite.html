      <h1>New W3C XML Schema Test Suite</h1>
      <p>
         
         A few weeks ago the W3C Schema working group published a new test suite, containing
         nearly 40,000 tests: see<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/2004/xml-schema-test-suite/">http://www.w3.org/XML/2004/xml-schema-test-suite/</a></p>
      <p>Since then, I've been putting a fair amount of effort into reconciling Saxon's results
         on these tests with the published results.</p>
      <p>My first attempt looked like this:</p>
      <pre><code>    expected    Saxon-SA     No of tests
    result      result
    valid       valid           24687
    invalid     invalid         13150
    valid       invalid           697
    invalid     valid             856
    not run                         9</code></pre>
      <p>The "not run" tests included 6 that blew memory because of large minOccurs/maxOccurs
         values, and 3 that crashed for another reason - deriving types directly from xs:anySimpleType.</p>
      <p>That's not bad for a first run (96% agreement), but obviously analyzing the 1500+
         discrepancies will take some time!</p>
      <p>Most of the 697 tests where the expected result was "valid" but Saxon reported "invalid"
         turned out to be regular expression tests submitted by Microsoft, where they seem
         to be allowing through all kinds of regex syntax that the Schema spec quite clearly
         doesn't allow.</p>
      <p>I'm now getting close to finishing the analysis of one of the three groups of tests,
         those submitted by Microsoft. I've raised 40 bugs so far against the test suite (go
         to http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/query.cgi and search under the Product heading "XML
         Schema Test Suite"). However, it's not all one-sided; I've also found about 30 bugs
         in Saxon schema processing. Unlike the regex tests, some of these tests were clearly
         written by people who knew the spec extremely well, and in some cases the test results
         are correct according to the letter of the spec despite being highly counter-intuitive.
         I haven't been reporting these individually on the SourceForge bug register because
         most of them are so obscure I think they can simply wait until the next release. </p>
      <p>Since there have been very few bug reports on Saxon's schema processing from the field,
         this suggests that there are many corners of the schema spec that few users stray
         into -- this makes the exercise a little frustrating, because it means that few users
         will notice the improvement from 99% conformance to 99.9%. It's an educational experience,
         however. Perhaps one of these days I will finally understand some of the more obscure
         utterances in Schema Part 1, such as the parenthetical "which must be understood as
         logically prior to this clause of this constraint, below" in 3.11.4, which has always
         had me completely baffled. Certainly, I've been spending a lot of time over the last
         few days poring over that kind of prose. I've also made a few comments on the spec
         where there seem (still, 5 years after publication and countless errata) to be remaining
         errors and inconsistencies.</p>
      <p>The availability of these tests should greatly help interoperability between schema
         processors, especially if the major processors all publish their results, and if the
         test suite is properly maintained to remove reported bugs. It will be interesting
         to see who publishes their results and who doesn't.<br />

                  in the domain and a focus on quality and conformance (all proven by a 5* track record)
                  has difficulty conforming to the specification (albeit corner cases); and (b) microsoft
                  has trouble writing conformance tests for the specification. surely this is a very
                  negative result for w3c xml schema!? what are mere mortals to do!? the barrier to
                  implementation is colossal. if we are to go around creating standards that are to
                  describe the foundations of our software infrastructure surely to goodness they ought
                  to be written such that it would be relatively straightforward to develop a fully
                  conformant implementation. &lt;/rant&gt; <br /></div>

               <div class="commentBody">99% is a great result! Well done Michael Kay. I am continually impressed by SAXON.
                  Organizations that use it should assertively consider buying licenses, in order to
                  let Dr Kay keep up the good work.<br />
                  Of course, large test suites have many repeats, so probably 99% of tests passing is
                  not the same as 99% of features covered.<br />
                  Of course, technical specs are only really aimed at the handful of implementers and
                  writers to understand; they just aren't end-user documents. And the XSD Structures
                  spec has many virtues as well as its obvious shortcomings. To a certain extent, end-users
                  never need to check the specification if either the technology is straight-forward
                  enough (guessable) or if the user documentation and diagnostics are clear enough.
                  So the question with XSD is not only "Can the spec be made clearer?" but also "Can
                  comprehensible user documentation be made?" and "Can end-user comprehensible diagnostics
                  be made?" Both these are areas of sheer man-hours, which is where buying SAXON licenses
                  can directly help: if you organization is using XSD as a mission-critical part, you
                  really should treat licensing as a basic part of risk-management.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Thanks for the comment, Rick. Actually I can't yet claim 99% - that's an estimate
                  of what it will be when I've done the analysis. The question on end-user comprehensible
                  diagnostics is a very pertinent one, and one where I've put a lot of effort. Xerces,
                  I think, achieves a very high level of conformance to the spec but falls down badly
                  on error messages. One of the problems when a spec uses very arcane language (as XSD
                  certainly does) is that as an implementer you have to decide whether to use the same
                  terminology in your messages. I tend to work on the basis that once I start talking
                  about particles, I've lost 90% of my audience, and if I were to report that the intersection
                  between two wildcards is inexpressible, or that "assessment with respect to a schema-like
                  entity is incoherent", then I would lose 99%. Another problem arises where the spec
                  says that "one of the following six (complex) conditions must be true". If none of
                  them is true, what do you tell the user? Pragmatically, you try and identify which
                  of them came closest to being satisfied, and report the error in terms of that condition.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">I've been considering implement W3C XML Schema(WXS) but put it off because of the
                  enormous amounts of work it requires(largely because of how the specs are written)
                  and that I hadn't found any easy way to assess whether I've implemented it correctly.<br />
                  But perhaps this has changed with this test suite? Can one rely on this test suite
                  for assessing how well ones validator will cope in the wild, or how crucial is it
                  to build a complementary test collection?</div>

               <div class="commentBody">I think you can probably treat this test suite as being pretty comprehensive. Even
                  the old test suite had enough coverage to cope with the things you were likely to
                  encounter "in the wild", though it missed a lot of edge cases needed for spec conformance.</div>
