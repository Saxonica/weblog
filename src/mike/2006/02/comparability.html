      <h1>Comparability</h1>
      <p>Interesting query submitted by a Saxon-SA XQuery user yesterday. They were reporting
         a bug in validating QNames in element content, but the thing that interested me was
         that they had written a rather complex function to determine whether two atomic values
         were equal, <em>without failing if the values aren't comparable</em>.</p>
      <p>If you test [@x eq 6], and @x is defined with a union type that allows both strings
         and numbers, then you'll get a type error if @x happens to contain a string. (With
         strict static typing, the query won't even compile). The same is true if you use the
         "=" operator. So this user had coded a complex set of nested typeswitch expressions
         to ensure that comparing two non-comparable values returned false rather than an error.</p>
      <p>In fact there's an easier way. In fact, there are at least two easier ways. Both the
         following expressions achieve the required aim:
         
         </p>
      <p>count(distinct-values((@x, @y))Â  eq 1</p>
      <p>exists(index-of(@x, @y))</p>
      <p>That's because in both distinct-values() and index-of(), we explicitly decided that
         non-comparable values should be treated as distinct, rather than causing an error.</p>
      <p>Why the difference? It's classic symptom of committee design. For "eq" and "=", the
         advocates of strong typing won the argument, for distinct-values() and index-of()
         the weak typists (probably me in this case) swayed the vote. Perhaps it just depended
         on who was paying attention when the matter came up for discussion.</p>
      <p>There are arguments both ways. There's even an argument for making different language
         features inconsistent with each other, so users can pick and choose! It doesn't feel
         like a very elegant piece of design, but it's nice to discover that there's a way
         of doing what's needed in this particular case.</p>
