      <h1>Thanks for the compliment</h1>
      <p>It's nice when people say nice things about you, though slightly embarrassing when
         they gush. Warm praise from Eliot Kimber at <a href="http://drmacros-xml-rants.blogspot.com/2006/02/some-tools-that-suck-significantly.html">http://drmacros-xml-rants.blogspot.com/2006/02/some-tools-that-suck-significantly.html</a></p>
      <blockquote><em>Another tool that doesn't really suck at all is the Saxon XSLT engine
            from Mike Kay. Saxon is remarkable in being software of the highest
            engineering quality that supports essentially 100% of the relevant
            standards and is backed by exceptional support, especially given that
            it's just one man doing it and it's free, open-source software. I don't
            think it's overstating things to say that Mike Kay is a god among men
            and it's not within my power to meaningfully repay him for the value
            that Saxon has provided me personally. It's the only XSLT engine I use
            both for feature reasons (it's the only implementation that provides
            the collator extension support I need) and for quality reasons: it is
            as close to a bug-free piece of non-trivial software as I've ever
            worked with, and its fast. Wicked fast.</em></blockquote>
