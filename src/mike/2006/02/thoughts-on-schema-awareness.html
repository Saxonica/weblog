      <h1>Thoughts on schema-awareness</h1>
      <p>Spent an hour this morning (with a client) tracking down an elusive bug in a stylesheet.
         As described in my <a href="http://www.stylusstudio.com/schema_aware.html">Stylus Studio article</a>, it was one of those classic problems where a path expression or match pattern selects
         nothing: and if the stylesheet had been schema-aware we would have found the problem
         in no time. So why wasn't it? Answer: because it was cobbled together quickly, and
         it was the second transformation in a pipeline, and the intermediate format was ad-hoc
         and local. But we could have generated a schema from the instance document after running
         the first step in the pipeline. Resolution: I must learn to take my own medicine.</p>
