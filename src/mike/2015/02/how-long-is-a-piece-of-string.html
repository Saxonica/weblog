      <h1>How long is a (piece of) string?</h1>
      <p>
         As I explained in my previous post, I've been re-examining the way functions work
         in Saxon. In particular, over the last week or two, I've been changing the way system
         functions (such as fn:string-length) work. There's a terrific amount of detail and
         complexity here, but I thought it might be interesting to take one simple function
         (fn:string-length) as an example, to see where the complexity comes from and how it
         can be reduced.
         </p>
      <p>
         At first sight, fn:string-length looks pretty simple. How long is a (piece of) string?
         Just ask Java to find out: surely it should just map to a simple call on java.lang.String.length().
         Well, no actually.
         </p>
      <p>
         If we look to the specification, there are two complications we have to deal with.
         Firstly we are counting the number of Unicode characters, not (as Java does) the number
         of 16-bit UTF16 codepoints. In the case of surrogate pairs, one character occupies
         two codepoints, and that means that a nave implementation of string-length() takes
         time proportional to the length of the string.
         </p>
      <p>
         Secondly, there are two forms of the string-length() function. With zero arguments,
         it's defined to mean string-length(string(.)). That's different from nearly all other
         functions that have 0-argument and 1-argument forms, where (for example) name() means
         name(.). Saxon handles functions like name() by converting them statically to name(.),
         and that conversion doesn't work in this case. To illustrate the difference, consider
         an attribute code="003", defined in the schema as an xs:integer. The function call
         string-length(@code) returns 1 (it atomizes the attribute to produce an integer, converts
         the integer to the string "3", and then returns the length of this string. But @code!string-length()
         returns 3 - the length of the string value of the attribute node.
         </p>
      <p>
         The other complexity applies specifically to string-length#0 (that is, the zero-argument
         form). Dynamic calls to context-dependent functions bind the context at the point
         where the function is created, not where it is called. Consider:
         </p>
      <pre>&lt;xsl:for-each select="0 to 9"&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name="f" select="string-length#0"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:for-each select="21 to 50"&gt;
&lt;xsl:value-of select="$f()"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;</pre>
      <p>This will print the value "1" three hundred times. In each case the context item at
         the point where $f is bound is a one-digit integer, so $f() returns the length of
         that integer, which is always one. The context item at the point where $f() is evaluated
         is irrelevant.
         </p>
      <p>
         Now let's take a look at the Saxon implementation. There's a Java class StringLength
         which in Saxon 9.6 is about 200 lines of code (including blank lines, comments, etc),
         and this does most of the work. But not all: in the end all it does is to call StringValue.getStringLength(),
         which is what really does the work. Atomic values of type xs:string are represented
         in Saxon by an instance of the class StringValue, which encapsulates a Java CharSequence:
         often, but not always, a String. The reason for the encapsulating class is to provide
         type safety on methods like Function.call() which returns a Sequence; StringValue
         implements AtomicValue which implements Item which implements Sequence, so the XDM
         data model is faithfully represented in the Java implementation classes.
         </p>
      <p>
         In addition there's a class StringLengthCompiler which generates a bytecode implementation
         of the string-length function. This is another 60 or so lines.
         </p>
      <p>
         Some functions also have a separate streaming implementation to accept streamed input,
         and one or two (string-join() and concat(), for example), have an implementation designed
         to produce streamed output. That's designed to ensure that an instruction like &lt;xsl:value-of
         select="//emp/name" separator=","/&gt;, which compiles down to a call on string-join()
         internally, doesn't actually assemble the whole output in memory, but rather writes
         each part of the result string to the output stream as it becomes available.
         </p>
      <p>
         Since the introduction of dynamic function calls, many system functions have two separate
         implementations, one for static calls and one for dynamic calls. That's the case for
         string-length: the evaluateItem() method used for static calls is almost identical
         to the call() method used for dynamic calls. One reason this happened was because
         of a fear of performance regression that might occur if the existing code for static
         calls was generalized, rather than introducing a parallel path.
         </p>
      <p>
         In 9.6, the implementation of dynamic calls to context-dependent functions like string-length#0
         is rather fudged. In fact, the expression string-length#0 compiles into a call on
         function-lookup("fn:string", 0). The implementation of function-lookup() keeps a copy
         of both the static and dynamic context at the point where it is called, and this is
         then used when evaluating the resulting function. This is vastly more expensive than
         it needs to be: for functions like string-length#0 where there are no arguments other
         than the context, the function can actually be pre-evaluated at the point of creation.
         In the new 9.7 implementation, the result of the expression string-length#0 is a function
         implemented by the class ConstantFunction, which encapsulates its result and returns
         this result when it is called. (It's not quite as simple as this, because the constant
         function also has to remember its name and arity, just in case the user asks.)
         </p>
      <p>
         The method StringValue.getStringLength() attempts to recognize cases where walking
         through the codepoints of the string to look for surrogate pairs is not actually necessary.
         In previous releases there was an extra bit kept in StringValue, set when the string
         was known to contain no surrogate pairs: so having walked the string once, it would
         never be done again. In 9.6 this mechanism is replaced with a different approach:
         Saxon includes several implementations of CharSequence that maintain the value as
         an array of fixed-size integers (8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit, as necessary). If the CharSequence
         within a StringValue is one of these classes (known collectively as UnicodeString),
         then the length of the string is the length of the array. And when getStringLength()
         is called on a string the first time, the string is left in this form, in the hope
         that future operations on the string will benefit. Of course, this will in some cases
         be counter-productive (and there's a further refinement in the implementation, which
         I won't go into, that's designed to overcome this).
         </p>
      <p>
         There are a few other optimizations in the implementation of string-length() that
         are worth mentioning. Firstly, it's quite common for users to write
         </p>
      <pre>&lt;xsl:if test="string-length($x) != 0"&gt;
</pre>
      <p>
         Here we don't need to count surrogate pairs in the string: the string is zero-length
         if and only if the underlying CharSequence is zero-length. Saxon therefore does a
         static rewrite of such an expression to boolean(string($x)). (If $x is statically
         known to be a string, the call string($x) will then be further rewritten as $x.)
         </p>
      <p>
         If string-length#1 is applied to a value that can be computed statically, then the
         string-length function is itself computed statically. (This optimization, for odd
         historical reasons, is often called "constant folding". It's possible only when there
         are no context dependencies.)
         </p>
      <p>
         During type-checking, the implementation of string-join#0 keeps a note of whether
         a context item is known to exist. This is used during byte-code generation; if it's
         known that the context item won't be absent, then there is no need to generate code
         to check for this error condition. It's through tiny optimizations like this that
         generated bytecode ends up being faster than interpreted code.
         </p>
      <p>
         In my current exercise refactoring the implementation of system functions such as
         string-length, I've been looking at how much of logic is duplicated either across
         the different implementations of a single function (streamed and unstreamed, static
         and dynamic, bytecode and interpreted) or across the implementations of functions
         that have a lot in common (such as string(), string-length(), and normalize-space()).
         I've found that with the exception of the core code in StringValue.getStringLength,
         and the optimization of string-length()=0, everything else can be vastly reduced.
         In place of the original StringLength class, there are now two (inner) classes StringLength_0
         and StringLength_1 each of which consists of a single one-line method. The code for
         generating byte-code can also be considerably simplified by achieving more reuse across
         different functions.
         </p>
      <p>
         The main essence of the reorganization is that the class StringLength (or rather,
         its two variants) are no longer Expressions, they are now Functions. Previously a
         call onto string-length($x) compiled to an expression, held as a node on the expression
         tree. Now it compiles into two object, a StringLength object which is a pure function,
         and a SystemFunctionCall object which is an expression that calls the function. The
         SystemFunctionCall object is generic across all functions, while the implementations
         of SystemFunction contain all the code that is specific to one function. This change
         was motivated primarily by the need to handle dynamic function calls (and hence first-class
         function objects) properly, but it has provided a stimulus for a refactoring that
         achieves much more than this.
         </p>
      <p>
         So, how long is a piece of string? At least we now know how to work it out more efficiently.
         Sorry this little yarn wasn't shorter.</p>
