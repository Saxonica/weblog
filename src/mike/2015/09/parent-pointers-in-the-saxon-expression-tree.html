      <h1>Parent pointers in the Saxon expression tree</h1>
      <p>A while ago (<a href="/mike/2014/11/redesigning-the-saxon-expression-tree.html">https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2014/11/redesigning-the-saxon-expression-tree.html</a>) I wrote about my plans for the Saxon expression tree. This note is an update.
         </p>
      <p>
         We've made a number of changes to the expression tree for 9.7.
         </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            
            <p>Every node in the tree (every expression) now references a
               Location object, providing location information for diagnostics
               (line number, column number, etc). Previously the expression node
               implemented the SourceLocator interface, which meant it provided
               this information directly. The benefit is that we can now have
               different kinds of Location object. In XQuery we will typically hold
               the line and column and module URI. In XSLT, for a subexpression
               within an XPath expression, we can now hold both the offset within
               the XPath expression, and the path to the containing node within the
               XSLT stylesheet. Hopefully debuggers and editing tools such as
               oXygen and Stylus Studio will be able to take advantage of the
               improved location information to lead users straight to the error
               location in the editor. Where an expression has the same location
               information as its parent or sibling expressions, the Location
               object is shared.</p>
            
            
            <p>Another reason for changing the way we hold location information
               is connected with the move to separately-compiled packages in XSLT
               3.0. This means that the system we previously used, of
               globally-unique integer "location identifiers" which are translated
               into real location information by reference to a central "location
               provider" service, is no longer viable.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            <p>Every node in the tree now points to a RetainedStaticContext
               object which holds that part of the static context which can vary from
               one expression to another, and which can be required at run-time.
               Previously we only attempted to retain the parts of the static context
               that each kind of expression actually used. The parts of the static
               context that this covers include the static base URI, in-scope
               namespaces, the default collation, and the XPath 1.0 compatibility
               flag. Retaining the whole static context might seem extravagent. But
               in fact, it very rarely changes, so a child expression will nearly
               always point to the same RetainedStaticContext object as its parent
               and sibling expressions.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            <p>Every node in the tree now points to its parent node. This choice has proved tricky.
               It gives many advantages: it means that the code for every expression can easily find
               details of the containing package, the configuration options, and a host of details
               about the query or stylesheet as a whole. The fact that we have a parent node eliminates
               the need for the "container" object (typically the containing function or template)
               which we held in previous releases. It also reduces the need to pass additional information
               to methods on the Expression class, for example methods to determine the item type
               and cardinality of the expression. There is a significant downside to holding this
               information, which is the need to keep it consistent. Some of the tree rewrite operations
               performed by the optimizer are complex enough without having to worry about keeping
               all the parent pointers correct. And it turns out to be quite difficult to enforce
               consistency through the normal "private data, public methods" encapsulation techniques:
               those work when you have to keep the data in a single object consistent, but they
               aren't much use for maintaining mutual consistency between two different objects.
               In any case it seems to be unavoidable that to achieve the kind of tree rewrites we
               want to perform, the tree has to be temporarily inconsistent at various stages.</p>
            
            
            <p>Using parent pointers means that you can't share subtrees. It means that when you
               perform operations like inlining a function, you can't just reference the subtree
               that formed the body of the function, you have to copy it. This might seem a great
               nuisance. But actually, this is not a new constraint. It never was safe to share subtrees,
               because the optimiser would happily make changes to a subtree without knowing that
               there were
               other interested parties. The bugs this caused have been an irritation for years.
               The introduction of parent pointers makes the constraint more explicit, and makes
               it possible to perform integrity checking on the tree to discover when we have inadvertently
               violated the constraints.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>
               During development we've had diagnostic code switched on that checks the integrity
               of the tree and outputs warnings if problems are found. We've gradually been examining
               these and eliminating them. The problems can be very hard to diagnose, because the
               detection of a problem in the data may indicate an error that occurred in a much earlier
               phase of processing. We've developed some diagnostic tools for tracing the changes
               made to a particular part of the tree and correlating these with the problems detected
               later. Most of the problems, as one might expect, are connected with optimization
               rewrites. A particular class of problem occurs with rewrites that are started but
               then not completed, (because problems are found) or with "temporary" rewrites that
               are designed to create an equivalent expression suitable for analysis (say for streamability
               analysis or for schema-aware static type-checking) but which are not actually intended
               to affect the run-time interpreted tree. The discipline in all such cases is to copy
               the part of the tree you want to work on, rather than making changes in-situ.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>
               For some non-local rewrites, such as loop-lifting optimizations, the best strategy
               seems to be to ignore the parent pointers until the rewrite is finished, and then
               restore them during a top-down tree-walk.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>
               The fact that we now have parent pointers makes context-dependent optimizations much
               easier. Checking, for example, whether Â a variable reference occurs within a loop
               (a "higher-order expression" as the XSLT 3.0 spec calls it) is now much easier: it
               can be done by searching upwards from the variable reference rather than retaining
               context information in an expression visitor as you walk downwards. Similarly, if
               there is a need to replace one expression by another (a variable reference by a literal
               constant, say), the fact that the variable reference knows its own parent makes the
               substitution much easier.
               </p>
            
            
            <p>
               So although the journey has had a few bumps, I'm reasonably confident that we will
               see long-term benefits.</p>
