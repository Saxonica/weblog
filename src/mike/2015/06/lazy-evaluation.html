      <h1>Lazy Evaluation</h1>
      <p>We've seen some VM dumps recently that
         showed evidence of contention problems when multiple threads
         (created, for example, using &lt;xsl:for-each&gt;
         with the saxon:threads
         attribute) were attempting lazy evaluation of the same local
         variable. So I've been looking at the lazy evaluation code in Saxon
         to try and understand all the permutations of how it works. A blog
         posting is a good way to try and capture that understanding before I
         forget it all again. But I won't go into the extra complexities of
         parallel execution just yet: I'll come back to that at the end.</p>
      <p>Lazy evaluation applies when a variable
         binding, for example "let
         $v := //x[@y=3]" isn't evaluated immediately when the
         variable declaration is encountered, but only when the variable is
         actually referenced. This is possible in functional languages because
         evaluating an expression has no side-effects, so it doesn't matter
         when (or how often) it is done. In some functional languages such as
         Scheme, lazy evaluation happens only if you explicitly request it. In
         others, such as Haskell, lazy evaluation is mandated by the language
         specification (which means that a variable can hold an infinite
         sequence, so long as you don't try to process its entire value). In
         XSLT and XQuery, lazy evaluation is entirely at the discretion of the
         compiler, and in this post I shall try to summarize how Saxon makes
         use of this freedom.</p>
      <p>Internally, when a local variable is
         evaluated lazily, Saxon instead of putting the variable's value in
         the relevant slot on the stack, will instead put a data structure
         that contains all the information needed to evaluate the variable:
         that is, the expression itself, and any part of the evaluation
         context on which it depends. In Saxon this data structure is called a
         Closure. The terminology isn't quite right, because it's not quite
         the same thing as the closure of an inline function, but the concepts
         are closely related: in some languages, lazy evaluation is
         implemented by storing, as the value of the variable, not the
         variable's actual value, but a function which delivers that value
         when invoked, and the data needed by this function to achieve that
         task is correctly called a closure. (If higher-order functions had
         been available in Saxon a few years earlier, we might well have
         implemented lazy evaluation this way.)
         </p>
      <p>We can distinguish two levels of lazy
         evaluation. We might use the term "deferred evaluation" to
         indicate that a variable is not evaluated until it is first
         referenced, and "incremental evaluation" to indicate that
         when it is referenced, it is only evaluated to the extent necessary.
         For example, if the first reference is the function call head($v),
         only the first item in the sequence $v will be evaluated; remaining
         items will only be evaluated if a subsequent reference to the
         variable requires them.</p>
      <p>Lazy evaluation can apply to global
         variables, local variables, parameters of templates and functions,
         and return values from templates and functions. Saxon handles each
         case slightly differently.</p>
      <p>We should mention some static
         optimizations which are not directly related to lazy evaluation, but
         are often confused with it. First, a variable that is never
         referenced is eliminated at compile-time, so its initializing
         expression is never evaluated at all. Secondly, a variable that is
         only referenced once, and where the reference is not in any kind of
         loop, is inlined: that is, the variable reference is replaced by the
         expression used to initialize the variable, and the variable itself
         is then eliminated. So when someone writes "let
         $x := /a/b/c return $x[d=3]",  Saxon turns this into the
         expression "(/a/b/c)[d=3]".
         (Achieving this of course requires careful attention to the static
         and dynamic context, but we won't go into the details here.)</p>
      <p>Another static optimization that
         interacts with variable evaluation is loop-lifting. If an expression
         within a looping construct (for example the content of xsl:for-each,
         or of a predicate, or the right-hand-side of the "/"
         operator) will have the same value for every iteration of the loop,
         then a new local variable bound to this expression is created outside
         the loop, and the original expression is replaced by a reference to
         the variable. In this situation we need to take care that the
         expression is not evaluated unless the loop is executed at least once
         (both to avoid wasted evaluation cost, and to give the right
         behaviour in the event that evaluating the expression fails with a
         dynamic error.) So lazy evaluation of such a variable becomes
         mandatory.</p>
      <p>The combined effect of these static
         optimizations, together with lazy evaluation, is that the order of
         evaluation of expressions can be quite unintuitive. To enable users
         to understand what is going on when debugging, it is therefore normal
         for some of these rewrites to be suppressed if debugging or tracing
         are enabled.</p>
      <p>For global variables, Saxon uses
         deferred evaluation but not incremental evaluation. A global variable
         is not evaluated until it is first referenced, but at that point it
         is completely evaluated, and the sequence representing its value is
         held in memory in its entirety.</p>
      <p>For local variables, evaluation is
         generally both deferred and incremental. However, the rules are quite
         complex.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>If the static type shows that the
               value will be a singleton, then it will be evaluated eagerly. [It's
               not at all clear that this rule makes sense. Certainly, incremental
               evaluation makes no sense for singletons. But deferred evaluation
               could still be very useful, for example if the evaluation is
               expensive and the variable is only referenced within a branch of a
               conditional, so the value is not always needed.]</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>Eager evaluation is used when the
               binding expression is very simple: in particular when it is a
               literal or a reference to another variable.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>Eager evaluation is used for
               binding expressions that depend on position()
               or last(), to
               avoid the complexities of saving these values in the Closure.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>There are some optimizations which
               take precedence over lazy evaluation. For example if there are
               variable references using predicates, such as $v[@x=3],
               then the variable will not only be evaluated eagerly, but will also
               be indexed on the value of the attribute @x.
               Another example: if a variable is initialized to an expression such
               as ($v, x) -
               that is, a sequence that appends an item to another variable -
               then we use a "shared append expression" which is a data
               structure that allows a sequence to be constructed by appending to
               an existing sequence without copying the entire sequence, which is a
               common pattern in algorithms using head-tail recursion.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>Lazy evaluation (and inlining)
               need special care if the variable is declared outside a try/catch
               block, but is referenced within it. In such a case a dynamic error
               that occurs while evaluating the initialization expression must not
               be caught by the try/catch; it is logically outside its scope.
               (Writing this has made me realise that this is not yet implemented
               in Saxon; I have written a test case and it currently fails.)</p>
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If none of these special circumstances
         apply, lazy evaluation is chosen. There is one more choice to be
         made: between a Closure
         and a MemoClosure.
         The common case is a MemoClosure,
         and in this case, as the variable is incrementally evaluated, the
         value is saved for use when evaluating subsequent variable
         references. A (non-memo) closure is used when it is known that the
         value will only be needed once. Because most such cases have been
         handled by variable inlining, the main case where a non-memo closure
         is used is for the return value of a function. Functions, like
         variables, are lazily evaluated, so that the value returned to the
         caller is not actually a sequence in memory, but a closure containing
         all the information needed to materialize the sequence. (Like most
         rules in this story, there is an important exception: tail-call
         optimization, where the last thing a function does is to call itself,
         takes precedence over lazy evaluation).</p>
      <p>So let's look more closely at the
         MemoClosure. A
         MemoClosure is a
         data structure that holds the following information:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>The Expression itself (a pointer
               to a node in the expression tree). The Expression object also holds
               any information from the static context that is needed during
               evaluation, for example namespace bindings.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>A copy of the dynamic context at
               the point where the variable is bound. This includes the context
               item, and values of any local variables referenced by the
               expression.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>The current evaluation state: one
               of UNREAD (no access to the variable has yet been made), MAYBE_MORE
               (some items in the value of the variable are available, but there
               may be more to come), ALL_READ (the value of the variable is fully
               available), BUSY (the variable is being evaluated), or EMPTY
               (special case of ALL_READ in which the value is known to be an empty
               sequence).</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>An InputIterator:
               an iterator over the results of the expression, relevant when
               evaluation has started but has not finished</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>A reservoir: a list containing the
               items delivered by the InputIterator so far.</p>
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many variable references, for example
         <code>count($v)</code>, or
         <code>index-of($v, 'z')</code>
         result in the variable being evaluated in full. If this is the first
         reference to the variable, that is if the state is UNREAD, the logic
         is essentially</p>
      <pre>inputIterator = expression.iterate(savedContext);

for item in inputIterator {
  reservoir.add(item);
}
state = ALL_READ;
return new SequenceExtent(reservoir);</pre>
      <p>(However, Saxon doesn't optimize this
         case, and it occurs to me on writing this that it could.)</p>
      <p>Other variable references, such as
         head($v), or
         $v[1], or
         subsequence($v, 1, 5),
         require only partial evaluation of the expression. In such cases
         Saxon creates and returns a ProgressiveIterator,
         and the requesting expression reads as many items from the
         ProgressiveIterator
         as it needs. Requests to get items from the ProgressiveIterator
         fetch items from the reservoir to the extent they are available; on
         exhaustion of the reservoir, they then attempt to fetch items from
         the InputIterator until either enough items are available, or the
         InputIterator is exhausted. Items delivered from the InputIterator
         are copied to the reservoir as they are found.</p>
      <p>So far so good. This has all been in
         place for years, and works well. We have no evidence that it is in
         any way optimal, but it has been carefully tweaked over the years to
         deal with particular cases where it was performing badly. What has
         changed recently is that local variables can be referenced from
         multiple threads. There are two particular cases where this happens
         today: when xsl:result-document
         is used in Saxon-EE, it executes by default asynchronously in a new
         thread; and when the extension attribute saxon:threads
         is used on xsl:for-each,
         the items selected by the xsl:for-each
         are processed in parallel rather than sequentially.</p>
      <p>The effect of this is that the
         MemoClosure object needs to be thread-safe: multiple requests to
         access the variable can come simultaneously from different threads.
         To achieve this a number of methods are synchronized. One of these is
         the next() method
         of the ProgressiveIterator:
         if two threads reference the variable at the same time, each gets its
         own ProgressiveIterator,
         and the next()
         method on one of these iterators is forced to wait until the other
         has finished.</p>
      <p>This works, but it is risky. Brian
         Goetz in his excellent book <i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i>
         recommends that a method should not be synchronized unless (a) its
         execution time is short, and (b) as the author of the method, you
         know exactly what code will execute while it is active. In this case
         neither condition is satisfied. The next()
         method of ProgressiveIterator
         calls the next()
         method of the InputIterator,
         and this may perform expensive computation, for example retrieving
         and parsing a document using the doc()
         function. Further, we have no way of analyzing exactly what code is
         executed: in the worst case, it may include user-written code (for
         example, an extension function or a URIResolver).
         The mechanism can't deadlock with itself (because there cannot be a
         cycle of variable references) but it is practically impossible to
         prove that it can't deadlock with other subsystems that use
         synchronization, and in the face of maliciously-written used code,
         it's probably safe to assume that deadlock <b>can</b> occur. We
         haven't seen deadlock happen in practice, but it's unsatisfactory
         that we can't prove its impossibility.</p>
      <p>So what should we do about it?</p>
      <p>I think the answer is, add yet another
         exception to the list of cases where lazy evaluation is used:
         specifically, don't use it for a variable that can be referenced from
         a different thread. I'm pretty sure it's possible to detect such
         cases statically, and they won't be very common. In such cases, use
         eager evaluation instead.</p>
      <p>We must be careful not to do this in
         the case of a loop-lifted variable, where the correct error semantics
         depend on lazy evaluation. So another tweak to the rules is, don't
         loop-lift code out of a multithreaded execution block.</p>
      <p>This investigation also suggests a few
         other refinements we might make.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>It seems worth optimizing for the
               case where the entire value of a variable is needed, since this case
               is so common. The problem is, it's not easy to detect this case: a
               calling expression such as count($v)
               will ask for an iterator over the variable value, without giving any
               indication that it intends to read the iterator to completion.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>We need to reassess the rule that
               singleton local variables are evaluated eagerly.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>We currently avoid using lazy
               evaluation for expressions with certain dependencies on the dynamic
               context (for example, position()
               and last()). But
               in the course of implementing higher-order functions, we have
               acquired the capability to hold such values in a saved copy of the
               dynamic context.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>We could look at a complete
               redesign that takes advantage of higher-order functions and their
               closures. This might be much simpler than the current design; but it
               would discard the benefits of years of fine-tuning of the current
               design.</p>
            </li>
         <li>
            
            
            <p>I'm not convinced that it makes
               sense for a MemoClosure
               to defer creation of the InputIterator
               until the first request for the variable value. It would be a lot
               simpler to call inputIterator
               = Expression.iterate(context) at the point of variable
               declaration; in most cases the implementation will defer evaluation
               to the extent that this makes sense, and this approach saves the
               cost of the elaborate code to save the necessary parts of the
               dynamic context. It's worth trying the other approach and making
               some performance measurements.
