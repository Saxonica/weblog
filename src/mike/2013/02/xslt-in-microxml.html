      <h1>XSLT in MicroXML?</h1>
      <p>Listening to Uche Ogbuji's talk at XML Prague this morning, it was
         great news to hear that namespaces are being thrown out of the
         window[1]. The complexity that namespaces add to the XML stack is
         vast, and the value they add is tiny.
         </p>
      <p>But it raises the question, can one represent an XSLT stylesheet as
         an XML document without using namespaces? Clearly there needs to be
         some way to distinguish XSLT instructions from literal result
         elements, and this seems to be one of the more justifiable uses of
         namespaces.
         </p>
      <p>My immediate thought is, let the outermost element of an XSLT stylesheet be
         </p>
      <pre>&lt;xxx.transform&gt;</pre>
      <p>where xxx is any prefix you care to choose; and then let all XSLT
         instructions in the stylesheet use the same prefix "xxx". For most
         people "xsl" would be a suitable prefix, so you would write
         </p>
      <pre>&lt;xsl.transform&gt;
  &lt;xsl.template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;out&gt;
      &lt;xsl.copy-of select="."/&gt;
    &lt;/out&gt;
 &lt;/xsl.template&gt;
&lt;/xsl.transform&gt;
</pre>
      <p>it takes a bit of getting used to typing "." instead of ":", but
         apart from that, it seems to work perfectly well. And you don't need
         xsl:namespace-alias any more to read or write XSLT stylesheets, which
         must be good: you simply use a different prefix for the output
         stylesheet.
         </p>
      <p>Norm Walsh tweeted that XSLT was claiming ownership of all names
         ending in ".transform". But that's not the case. The name doesn't have
         global significance; it only has significance in the context of the
         input supplied to an XSLT processor. Names are local and contextual,
         that's the point. Arguably there is still more redundancy than we need
         - we know the document we are reading is a stylesheet, so why do we
         need a top-level element to confirm the fact? (That's not to say all
         redundancy is bad, just to make the point that it's redundant).

         </p>
      <p><b>Further thoughts</b></p>
      <p>It's not only the XSLT namespace and its use in XSLT instructions
         that needs to be addressed, of course.
         </p>
      <p>Namespaces in the names of variables, templates, modes, keys,
         decimal formats and so on can safely be ignored. Hardly anyone uses
         them anyway.
         </p>
      <p>Functions are a bit more awkward. XSLT has never seriously
         committed to the use of the "fn" namespace for system functions (it's
         always the default, so no prefix is ever needed), but it does require
         user-written functions to be in a namespace to distinguish them from
         system-supplied functions; and external function libraries also use
         namespaces in a similar way. I've always felt the right approach for
         resolving function names is a search list - it shouldn't be necessary
         to prefix each function name to identify its library, rather it should
         be possible to define a list of function libraries to be searched when
         looking for functions with a given local name. The MicroXML philosophy
         would suggest getting rid of URIs from function names entirely, but
         that's a big change; transitionally, a list of URIs to be searched
         plus the XSLT 3.0 EQName facility if you need to be more explicitly
         would probably meet the requirement.
         </p>
      <p>Step back, however. What are we trying to achieve? If we want to
         eliminate namespaces entirely from the whole stack, then we need to
         think about a namespace-less XSD (shudder!) or a typeless XSLT (losing
         integers and dates would be a big step back). If our goals are less
         ambitious, then what are they? Being able to transform MicroXML
         documents doesn't require an XSLT change at all.
         </p>
      <p>I think MicroXML is a first step along a road that is not well
         charted. While the goals are laudable, the route to a simpler cleaner
         world is not a straightforward one.</p>
