      <h1>Reducing the size of Saxon-CE</h1>
      <p>During the early stages of Saxon-CE development, the major part of the work was cutting
         Saxon down to size to run on the browser. That initial work was described in an earlier
         post: see <i>Cutting Saxon down to size</i>: <a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2010/11/cutting-saxon-down-to-size.html">https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2010/11/cutting-saxon-down-to-size.html</a><br />
         In the last couple of weeks I've resumed the effort to reduce the size of the code.
         This article examines the changes I've made, and the opportunities for further reduction.
         </p>
      <p>
         Saxon-CE 1.1 is around 880Kb, and so far, I've reduced that to 780Kb. I'm measuring
         the size of the main Javascript download here, not the ancillary data files that may
         or may not be downloaded, depending on what the stylesheet actually does. Reducing
         the size is important because the download time causes an appreciable delay on the
         first visit to a site, and first impressions are important; cutting the delay from
         say 7 seconds to 5 seconds will result in a corresponding reduction in the number
         of visitors who don't bother to wait.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>What has gone?</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         About half this reduction was achieved by rewriting two data-intensive classes to
         load their data from XML files on demand, rather that defining it in static initialization
         code. The two classes in question are Categories, which contains the mapping of Unicode
         characters to categories used in regular expressions such as Lu and Nd; and CaseVariants,
         used when the "i" flag appears in a regular expression to determine all the upper/lower
         case variants of any character. These XML files are downloaded only if the relevant
         language features are used in the stylesheet.
         </p>
      <p>
         A couple of other classes were also performing lengthy static initializing: StandardFunctions,
         which contains details of all the system functions in the core library, and StandardNames,
         which contains the names of all XSLT elements, attributes, and built-in types. In
         the case of StandardFunctions the amount of initialization code has been vastly reduced
         by introducing a micro-syntax to describe function signatures in the form of a string
         literal, which can be easily parsed in a few lines of code. In the case of StandardNames,
         the class was setting up a mapping from integer constants to QNames; this has been
         removed by changing the product to use QNames throughout (or in the case of types,
         the object instances representing each built-in type) rather than integer constants.
         </p>
      <p>
         Associated with this second change, the NamePool has gone. Saxon-CE was not getting
         any real benefit from the NamePool, because the source document is always in the form
         of a DOM, in which names are held as strings. So integer fingerprints were being allocated
         on demand, which cancels any saving from faster integer comparisons. The change to
         use QName objects in place of namecodes and fingerprints throughout the product was
         of course very extensive, but it seems to have been trouble-free. There is only one
         very minor loss of functionality: in cases where Saxon has to invent a prefix for
         use on a constructed element or attribute, it is no longer able to consult the NamePool
         to see what prefixes have previously been used with that URI.
         </p>
      <p>
         The other changes are minor and tedious. They fall into a number of categories:
         </p>
      <p>
         * Finding code that could never be executed. Although GWT automatically eliminates
         code that is completely unreachable, there is code that cannot be executed in practice
         for details that GWT cannot detect. Two examples: (a) code for matching types such
         as attribute(*, xs:date). Although a basic XSLT processor allows this syntax, all
         nodes in Saxon-CE are untyped, so this type will never match anything. It can therefore
         be replaced during parsing by a type that matches no instances, which cuts out a lot
         (well a couple of Kb) of useless code. (b) there was still a lot of code designed
         to report the line number on which errors occurred, both statically and dynamically.
         But in the browser environment, the XML parser provides no line number information,
         so this code was useless.
         </p>
      <p>
         * Eliminating duplication. For example, I found that there were two completely separate
         mechanisms for maintaining comparison keys, one mechanism used for xsl:for-each-group
         and distinct-values, the other used for sorting and various other operations. Although
         there were a few semantics differences (for example in the handling of NaN) it proved
         reasonably easy to combine these two mechanisms into one.
         </p>
      <p>
         * Cutting out minor optimizations. Do we really need a separate class to handle hash
         maps in which the key is an unboxed integer, rather than using the standard HashMap
         with a boxed integer key? Is that optimization worth 1000 lines of code? Probably
         not. There are many similar examples.
         </p>
      <p>
         * Cutting out small classes. Arithmetic expressions, for example, delegated the computation
         to one of a large number of small Calculator classes, each dedicated to one particular
         operation, such as (integer plus integer). This is an elegant design, but in GWT it
         appears to be expensive: each of these classes was generating up to 2Kb of code. Combining
         the classes into a set of switch expressions in the parent class appears to give a
         significant reduction in code size (though I have to admit I am not entirely sure
         why).
         </p>
      <p>
         In deciding whether to remove a particular piece of code, I find it useful to reverse
         the thinking: if this wasn't there already, would I consider it worthwhile adding
         it? This is analogous to zero-based budgeting: there is a presumption that something
         isn't needed unless it can be justified, rather than a presumption in favour of the
         status quo.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>Where will the next 100Kb come from?</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         Getting down from 880Kb to 780Kb is useful, but it isn't enough. The target should
         be something like 500Kb. Finding big savings, however, gets more and more difficult.
         There are plently of small salami-slices available, but they get harder to find.
         </p>
      <p>
         Some of the original areas in my earlier post remain unaddressed. There is still a
         lot of duplication between the "style" classes representing the source stylesheet,
         and the "instruct" classes on the expression tree. Historically, it was important
         to allow the source stylesheet tree to be garbage collected once compilation is finished;
         in Saxon-CE, that reasoning doesn't apply. Probably we should keep the instruction
         classes on the expression tree, but have them delegate a lot more to the original
         "style" elements to avoid duplication.
         </p>
      <p>
         The expression tree is a major opportunity for simplification. There are two issues:
         there are too many different kinds of expression (too many subclasses), and they implement
         too many methods. Specifically, there are 167 subclasses of Expression, and the class
         defines some 48 methods. Some of these classes are admittedly very small (FirstItemExpression,
         for example, which implements constructs of the form EXP[1], is just 157 bytes --
         I haven't worked out why these classes are so much smaller than the Calculator classes
         mentioned above). So compiling EXP[1] to a call on subsequence(EXP,1,1) would probably
         give no net saving. But despite much use of superclasses to hold shared functionality,
         there's still a fair bit of duplication that could be eliminated, and a large number
         of minor optimizations that probably have little merit.
         </p>
      <p>
         Could we drop the LinkedTree implementation of XDM? The Tinytree is already gone from
         Saxon-CE. The LinkedTree is only used (a) for stylesheets, and (b) for temporary trees:
         source documents and result documents use the Javascript DOM. (Not the GWT DOM). We
         could consider using the DOM also for stylesheets and for temporary trees. But it's
         only 20Kb. A more interesting way forward might be some kind of hybrid of the current
         LinkedTree and HTML-DOM-wrapped-tree; given the way Javascript works, we could consider
         adding properties to the DOM to make it implement the NodeInfo interface more directly,
         supplementing some of its deficiencies for example (notoriously) its poor support
         for namespaces.
         </p>
      <p>
         There is a lot of code whose main purpose is lazy (pipelined) evaluation. This leads
         to a proliferation of small specialized classes. Some of these are probably an unnecessary
         luxury. For the index-of() function, for example, do we really need a custom iterator
         that searches for the next match and returns it on demand, or would it do any harm
         to find all the matches up-front? In some cases several iterator implementations could
         be combined into one: for example the index-of() iterator could be handled by a flag
         in the filter iterator that returns the position of the matched item instead of the
         item itself.
         </p>
      <p>
         Generally, I think that finding another 100Kb of discardable code looks feasible,
         though it's a lot of work.
         </p>
      <p>
         <i>Note: Saxon-CE today is 64800 non-comment lines of Java code. Saxon-EE for comparison
            is 261100 non-comment lines.</i>
         <i><br /></i>
         <b>Update two weeks later:</b>
         <b><br /></b>
         This kind of exercise can become a bit obsessive. I'm now down just below 700Kb, and
         at the Java level the number of source lines is down to about 55000. It's amazing
         how much dead wood there is, and it's a great pleasure to get rid of it. By and large,
         most of the reductions have been achieved without adverse effects that anyone will
         notice, and in some cases it's been a real opportunity to tidy up the code and improve
         it. I'm very inclined to port some of the changes back to "big Saxon" (that is, the
         server-side code base).
         </p>
      <p>
         The changes made fall into a number of general categories:
         </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Avoiding duplication. For example, the code to do compile-time static type checking
            of function arguments (to implement the function conversion rules) was extremely similar
            to the code for dynamic conversion of supplied stylesheet parameters to their required
            type. A little bit of thought enabled the two to be combined. There was extensive
            duplication in the code for iterating different axes for different tree models. The
            code for xsl:next-match was about 95% the same as the code for xsl:apply-imports.
            There was perhaps 70% code overlap in the iterators for the union, except, and difference
            operators. There were half-a-dozen places in the product containing almost identical
            code for converting a lexical QName to an expanded QName given a namespace context.
            In some cases the duplication could be justified for "big Saxon", because of the imperative
            to minimize run-time pathlengths. But that's the wrong trade-off for Saxon-CE; the
            size of the code really does matter.</li>
         <li>Eliminating trivial optimizations. I already mentioned the "integer hash-map" example.
            There are plenty of examples of static rewrite optimizations that really don't justify
            themselves: rewriting string-length($x) = 0 as not(string($x)) is an example. You
            have to look at these and ask (a) whether the saving achieved is significant, and
            (b) whether the rule will fire often enough to be worthwhile. It's easy to make mistakes
            on both counts - nearly all these optimizations were added at some time because of
            a real use case where they made a significant difference. But over time they accumulate
            and gather dust; sometimes they cease to be relevant because something else has changed
            elsewhere in the system.</li>
         <li>Avoiding over-generalized code. GWT does a good job of identifying methods that are
            never called. But it can't spot methods that are capable of doing 17 things, and are
            only ever called upon to do one of those 17 things.</li>
         <li>Rewriting the code to be more compact. A couple of examples here: the code for checking
            the select attribute of xsl:value-of now reads "checkAttribute("select", "e")", where
            "select" is the name of the attribute, and "e" indicates that its value must be an
            expression. The previous code was about four times this long, and the extra stuff
            was essentially the same for every attribute of every element. Similarly, the code
            for registering details of the signatures of built-in functions, and the code for
            enumerating the subexpressions of every kind of expression: these fragments of code
            occur very often, and cutting them down from 4 lines to 1 can make a big difference
            overall.</li>
         <li>Simplifying error handling. Good diagnostics for errors are still important, but there
            was a lot of verbosity in this area that could go. If a date is invalid, how much
            detail do you need to give the user about the fact? Might it not be good enough to
            tell them that 2013-03-59 is an invalid date?</li>
      </ul>
