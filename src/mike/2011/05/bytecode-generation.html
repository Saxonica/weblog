      <h1>Bytecode generation</h1>
      <p>Since the beginning of the year a lot of our development effort has been going into
         bytecode generation. O'Neil has been working on this full-time, concentrating on the
         XQuery side, and I've been putting in a fair bit of time too, adding the things needed
         for XSLT. We're making good progress, with perhaps 80% of the tests current running
         successfully. We're publishing a paper on the subject at Balisage, but I thought it
         would be a good idea to give a more informal progress report here. 
         </p>
      <p>
         Firstly, what are the benefits? For the user, it looks like a fairly uniform speed-up
         of about 25%. Where we get more than that, we can usually see how the interpreter
         is doing a poor job; if we get less than that, it's because we aren't compiling code
         carefully enough. Comparing code that is well interpreted against code that is well
         compiled, the difference seems to be around 25%. 
         </p>
      <p>
         For Saxonica, this is a development that works well for our business model. We want
         users to pay us to take the commercial version of the product, and they are more likely
         to do so if there is an immediate measurable benefit as soon as you open the box:
         no need to write your code differently to exploit new features, no need to lock yourself
         into schema-aware processing (which has great benefits, but does require up-front
         investment). To some extent, the optimizer in Saxon-EE addresses the same business
         need, but the trouble is that the benefits are non-uniform: it achieves dramatic speed-up
         for a small number of queries and stylesheets, but for 90% of simple user code, especially
         XSLT code that has already been hand-optimized using keys, it makes no difference.
         As well as being the best way of getting a 25% performance boost, bytecode generation
         has the advantage for us that the performance boost is achieved by adding code that
         is naturally separate from and additional to the open source codebase, so we aren't
         doing anything technically artificial to ensure the feature is available only in the
         Enterprise edition. 
         </p>

         Saxon has had the ability to generate Java code for some time. In fact, my first foray
         into this area was with Saxon 4.1 back in 1999, before the XSLT 1.0 spec was even
         finalized. But that attempt was dropped because it seemed more important to focus
         on high-level algorithmic optimization of execution paths, which offered much better
         gains than the 25% achievable through code generation. More recently Java source generation
         found its way into Saxon-EE, but it hasn't been a conspicuous success (it certainly
         hasn't repaid the months of effort that went into doing it.) I think there are a number
         of reasons for this. One is that it only covers XQuery, whereas 90% of Saxon users,
         especially those requiring high performance, are writing in XSLT. Another is that
         it doesn't cover the whole of XQuery - there are various restrictions such as use
         of collations, extension functions, and the like. But the biggest drawback is that
         it's simply too much hassle: generating Java source code, compiling it, and then running
         it with the configuration set up correctly just takes too much effort and thought. 
         </p>
      <p>
         So this time around we're generating bytecode directly rather than Java source code.
         This means that it's completely transparent to the user, you simply won't see it happening.
         We're not writing bytecode that can be serialized to .class files and executed independently;
         it lives in memory only. This means it doesn't have to be self-contained; expressions
         that have been compiled are linked from the expression tree and invoked when necessary
         by the interpreter; similarly compiled expressions can refer back to interpreted code
         or other constructs such as schema definitions, collations, and the like. So the compiled
         code doesn't live in a separate world from interpreted code, which means we can be
         very selective about what we compile and what we interpret. We're not doing it yet,
         but the architecture certainly allows us to do "just-in-time" compilation of the parts
         of the code that are getting heavily used.
         We haven't yet tried it, but the bytecode generation should also work on .NET, in
         conjunction with the IKVM technology which translates bytecode to IL instructions
         as soon as a class is loaded. 
         </p>
      <p>
         The tool we are using to generate bytecode is ASM. We didn't do a detailed comparison
         against alternatives, but it seemed to tick the right boxes and we were able to get
         it to work very quickly. It's weakest point is probably diagnostics - it goes to enormous
         lengths to verify that the generated bytecode is correct, and then gives you very
         little information if it isn't. We've slowly been customizing the way we use the technology
         to improve this - and of course, we're making fewer mistakes in the code we generate
         as we become more experienced. Run-time diagnostics are still difficult - sadly, we
         can't use a Java debugger to single-step through the code we have generated, but again
         we've created a fair bit of infrastructure to allow diagnostics to be injected into
         the generated code. 
         </p>
      <p>
         My impression is that once you get used to it, generating bytecode is no more difficult
         than generating Java source (the only reason previous releases generated Java source
         is that I thought it would be easier - I was wrong). In some ways working at the bytecode
         level gives you more flexibility, because it is more composable; when generating Java
         you always have to worry about the fact that instructions can't appear inside an expression,
         which means you end up generating lots of unnecessary variables (which aren't necessarily
         optimized away when the code is compiled). Bytecode being a stack machine, it lends
         itself very well to compiling a composable expression language like XPath or XQuery. 
         </p>
      <p>
         The decision to allow compiled and interpreted code to be mixed means that we're not
         making any changes to run-time data structures. In particular, XSLT/XQuery variables
         are still held in XPathContext objects on the Java heap; they aren't held as local
         variables on the Java stack. 
         </p>
      <p>
         In deciding what should be compiled and what shouldn't, one criterion is obviously
         how heavily used the code is. But that's not the only criterion. Some code is very
         heavily used, but simply doesn't benefit from compilation. An example is conversion
         between doubles and strings. We could generate code to do this, but it would be no
         faster than calling the existing routine compiled from Java source. It's only possible
         for the compiled code to be faster if the interpreted code is doing things that don't
         need to be done. The interpreter in fact very rarely does things that don't need to
         be done, but it does spend a certain amount of time deciding whether it needs to do
         them, and that's the area where the 25% speed-up comes from. In fact, it's likely
         that nearly all the speed up comes from eliminating run-time testing of data that
         was placed in the expression tree during compilation (for example, type information)
         and from eliminating polymorphic method invocations (which is just another way in
         which run-time decisions are made). 
         </p>
      <p>
         We're not compiling any code below the NodeInfo interface, which means that the compiled
         code isn't committed to a particular tree representation. It's quite possible that
         we could make further (small) savings by generating code that only works with (say)
         the TinyTree, but that would reduce flexibility. We've learnt the lesson that people
         appreciate improved performance, but they don't want to pay a heavy price for it,
         for example in a reduced ability for a compiled query to work with any input tree. 
         </p>
      <p>
         It was definitely a good decision to delay doing bytecode generation until we had
         a mature stable product with advanced optimizations in place. The fact that we are
         generating bytecode makes it more difficult to change the repertoire of instructions
         on the expression tree, and thus to introduce new optimizations, but at this stage
         of development, we can live with that, since the major optimizations are already done.

               <div class="commentBody">I'll just mention here, for the benefit of people who would rather generate Java source
                  code (one thing's for sure, you get better diagnostics for it, and regression testing
                  is trivial), that a good way to consume the source is with Janino &lt;http://janino.net&gt;,
                  an embedded Java 1.4 compiler (it also understands static imports, autoboxing, and
                  covariant returns). Like ASM, it generates classes directly in memory, and can compile
                  isolated Java expressions, blocks, and class bodies as well as complete source "files".</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Current intent is that it will be in Saxon-EE 9.4, and will cover both XSLT and XQuery.
                  Of course, plans can change.</div>
