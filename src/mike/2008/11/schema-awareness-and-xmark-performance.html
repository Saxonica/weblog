      <h1>Schema-Awareness and XMark performance</h1>
      <p>When people ask what performance benefits they can expect from using schema-aware
         transformations and queries, I've often replied in a way that avoids setting expectations
         too high. Some queries can benefit significantly, others actually slow down because
         the extra cost of validating the input is not recovered by improvements in query execution
         speed. I've often stressed that the main benefit of schema-awareness is in the speed
         and ease of debugging and testing the query, not primarily in performance. But I've
         been taking another look at it, and I think I can probably start to be a bit more
         up-beat.</p>
      <p>We need to distinguish the performance boost you get from Saxon-SA, from the performance
         boost you get by making your queries schema-aware. Saxon-SA has an improved optimizer
         which will often give you benefits whether or not you use a schema. Let's focus on
         a couple of the queries in the XMark benchmark: q9, which is simple equi-join, and
         q11, which is a non-equijoin (it joins two node sequences, comparing nodes using the
         "&lt;" operator). Here are the figures for Saxon-B against the 1Mb and 10Mb versions
         of the database:</p>
      <p><code>         1Mb      10Mb<br />q9       39ms    3533ms</code><br /><code>q11      26ms    2447ms</code></p>
      <p>Clearly both queries show quadratic performance: ten times the data size, 100 times
         the execution time.</p>
      <p>Now run the same queries with Saxon-SA:</p>
      <p><code>         1Mb      10Mb<br />
            q9       1.7ms     19ms</code><br />
         <code>q11      27ms    2429ms</code></p>
      <p>An enormous improvement for q9, showing the effects of the equijoin optimization in
         Saxon-SA; but no impact at all on q11.</p>
      <p>Now let's see what happens if we make the queries schema-aware. The benchmark rules
         don't actually allow us to change the queries, but we're not trying to score benchmark
         points here, we're trying to improve our understanding of Saxon performance. To make
         the queries schema-aware we first have to write a schema for the XMark database, and
         then we have to add a few type declarations to the query source text. For example,
         q9 is changed to start:</p>
      <pre><code>import schema "" at "schema.xsd";
declare variable $auction as document-node(schema-element(site)) := .;

let $ca := $auction/site/closed_auctions/closed_auction
return ...</code></pre>
      <p>With Saxon 9.1.0.3 this changes the figures to</p>
      <p><code>         1Mb      10Mb<br />
            q9       2.1ms     22.7ms</code><br />
         <code>q11      17ms    1492ms</code></p>
      <p>Note that q9 is a little bit slower, q11 fairly significantly faster. Which exemplifies
         why I'm cautious about telling people what to expect.</p>
      <p>Now: something that I've had in mind for a very long time is to investigate what happens
         if I store typed values as well as string values in the tiny tree. In theory this
         gives a benefit because you only convert a string to a value such as a number or a
         date once, you don't do it each time the value is referenced. Today I finally got
         around to implementing this feature - it turns out to be only 100 lines of code or
         so. This is the impact:</p>
      <p><code>         1Mb      10Mb<br />
            q9       1.6ms     17.6ms</code><br />
         <code>q11      8.9ms    746.3ms</code></p>
      <p>That is: the performance of q9 is pulled back to the non-schema-aware level, while
         the speed of q11 doubles! It's still quadratic, of course, but a 100% speed improvement
         in a slow-running query is always welcome. Interestingly, this doesn't depend on the
         compiler having any extra knowledge, one could potentially get similar improvements
         simply by validating the input document and running the non-schema-aware query. When
         I try this, the results are:</p>
      <p><code>         1Mb      10Mb<br />
            q9       1.75ms     18.9ms</code><br />
         <code>q11      14.64ms  1249.5ms</code></p>
      <p>Although there's an improvement, it seems that the full benefit comes from have the
         typed values available as numbers at run-time, and the compiled code also knowing
         that they will be numbers at run-time.</p>
      <p>So: there seems to be considerable benefits in caching typed value. It's such a simple
         thing to do, it's really rather surprising it took me this long to realise it.</p>
      <p>At the same time, don't ignore the other benefits of
         schema-awareness. In this round, I discovered a problem with the
         version of q7 that I have been using: Q7. How many pieces of prose are
         in our database?</p>
      <pre><code>for $p in /site
return count($p//description) + count($p//annotation) + count($p//email)</code></pre>
      <p>The schema-aware compiler points out that there is no email element in the schema.
         I think that emailaddress was intended. But the query is strange anyway: annotation
         is a child element of description. Which all goes to underline the message, that performance
         really doesn't matter much unless the code is correct.</p>
