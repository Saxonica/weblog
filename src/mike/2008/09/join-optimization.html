      <h1>Join optimization</h1>
      <p>People ask me from time to time whether they can expect a performance gain from moving
         to Saxon-SA. The answer is: it depends!</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://monetdb.cwi.nl/xml/">Xmark benchmark</a> is a case in point. It's not a very satisfactory benchmark in many ways, because
         the queries are very "relational" in style, but there are some people with that kind
         of workload and so long as one accepts that it's not typical of every kind of workload,
         it's not a bad test.</p>
      <p>Here's how Saxon-B and Saxon-SA compare for the twenty queries in the test suite.
         This is version 8.7.1 (not yet released), running against a 10Mb data file, with timings
         in milliseconds.</p>
      <pre><code>Query    Saxon-SA    Saxon-B
  1           8           6
  2           6           6
  3          25          22
  4          24          21
  5           8           8
  6           4           4
  7          32          31
  8          38       11196
  9          50       14023
 10         104        1435
 11       13686       13005
 12        4296        3335
 13           3           3
 14         120         116
 15           4           4
 16           8           8
 17          11          11
 18          13          13
 19          66          66
 20          38          38</code></pre>
      <p>What do these numbers tell us? Firstly, the difference between 8ms and 6ms simply
         isn't statistically significant. So for 15 out of these 20 tests, the performance
         under Saxon-SA is essentially identical to that under Saxon-B. Then there are three
         tests (Q8, Q9, and Q10) where the performance under Saxon-SA is dramatically better
         (and the bigger the data file, the bigger the difference becomes. This is where the
         Saxon-SA optimizer has found a better strategy for evaluating a join.</p>
      <p>If we look at one of these queries Q8, it's like this:</p>
      <pre><code>(: Q8.  List the names of persons and the number of items they bought.
--     (joins person, closed\_auction)} :)

for $p in (:document("auction.xml"):)/site/people/person
let $a := for $t in (:document("auction.xml"):)/site
/closed_auctions/closed_auction
             where $t/buyer/@person = $p/@id
             return $t
return &lt;item person="{$p/name}"&gt; {count ($a)} &lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>The important thing is that "where" condition relating the two range variables $t
         and $p, both of which are defined in a "for" expression. Saxon-B here does two nested
         loops, testing each ($t, $p) pair to see if the condition is satisfied. Saxon-SA,
         by contrast, decides to build a hash index which avoids having to loop over all the
         $t items once for every $p.</p>
      <p>There are two join queries in the collection where Saxon-SA didn't make any difference,
         in fact things got slightly worse: Q11 and Q12.</p>
      <p>In Q11 and Q12, the join condition is</p>
      <pre><code>where $p/profile/@income &gt; (5000 * $i)</code></pre>
      <p>and Saxon at present isn't doing any optimization for non-equijoins (joins where the
         operator isn't "=" or "eq"). At present I don't know why Saxon-SA is performing worse
         for these two queries: it's not a major difference, but it's sufficiently significant
         to be worth investigating.</p>
      <p>The bottom line is: most queries probably run at about the same speed with Saxon-B
         and Saxon-SA. A few queries run dramatically faster with Saxon-SA.</p>
