      <h1>Tweaking the TinyTree</h1>
      <p>It's unusual to find anything these days that gives Saxon a 5% performance boost across
         the board, but I seem to have achieved that with some tweaks to the TinyTree data
         structure.</p>
      <p>Text nodes in the TinyTree aren't stored as separate String objects, but rather as
         start/length offsets into a single concatenated text buffer. The reason for that is
         that is to avoid the high Java space overhead associated with every String. At one
         time I stored this buffer as a single array (that is, char[]), but that requires a
         lot of character copying when the size increases, so I changed it a while ago to a
         custom data structure, the LargeStringBuffer, which breaks the text up into an array
         of segments. The segments were variable length, so that the string value of a text
         node could always be stored in a single segment, meaning that retrieving the string
         value never involves character copying. I've been aware for a while, however, from
         the results of profiling, that with a large document, finding the right segment can
         take a significant time (it uses a binary chop search).</p>
      <p>So I've been doing some experiments with a revised implementation of LargeStringBuffer
         that uses an array of fixed-length character arrays (65536 seems to work best). These
         means that text nodes can cross a segment boundary, in which case they will need to
         be copied, but the vast majority of text nodes still reside in one segment, and finding
         the text corresponding to a start position and length is now much faster. For any
         document above 1Mb or so the savings seem to be worthwhile, and there are no extra
         costs for small documents except perhaps that the minimum memory size is now 65536
         characters (and it may be possible to avoid that).</p>
      <p>The other long-standing idea on the TODO list for the TinyTree is to identify text
         nodes and attribute nodes that share the same value and use this fact to reduce the
         storage requirement. Some data-oriented XML should see a large space reduction from
         this. The downside, of course, as with any compression technique, is that it will
         take longer to build the tree. It's not difficult to do - but I hate adding performance
         features that are only used if the user sets a switch, because 99% of users will never
         discover its existence.</p>
