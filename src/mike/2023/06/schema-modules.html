        <p>Saxon, ever since we first introduced schema awareness back in 2004, has always
        worked with a single global schema maintained at the level of the <code>Configuration</code>
        object. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, and
        looks at possible alternatives.</p>
        
        <p>Let's start by getting some terminology clear. A <b>schema</b>, in the terminology
        of the XSD specification, is a set of schema components (such as element declarations
        and type definitions). Don't confuse it with a <b>schema document</b>, which is an
        XML document rooted at an <code>xs:schema</code> element. A <b>schema</b>
        is what you get when you compile a collection of schema documents linked to each
        other using <code>xs:include</code> and <code>xs:import</code> declarations.</p>
        
        <p>Not every set of schema components constitutes a valid schema. Most obviously
        you can't have two different components (for example, two type definitions) with the
        same name, unless they are identical. The XSD specification is a bit fuzzy about what
        it means for two components to be identical.</p>
        
        <p>This means that in general, you can try and combine two schemas into one by
        taking their union, but the operation won't always succeed because the two
        schemas may be found to be inconsistent with each other.</p>
        
        <h2>The Global Schema</h2>
        
        <p>Saxon currently maintains a global schema at the level of the <code>Configuration</code>
        object. This means that every time you introduce a new schema, for example by
        compiling a schema-aware query or stylesheet that has an <code>import schema</code> declaration,
        or by validating a document against a schema loaded using the <code>SchemaManager</code>
        API, or referenced using <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code>, the schema components
        from that schema are added to the global pool, provided they are consistent with
        the declarations already present in the pool.</p>
        
        <p>These consistency checks are of two kinds:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Firstly, the new components must not have names that clash with the old.
            You can't have two different types with the same name. To test whether two types
            are the same, Saxon basically checks that they came from the same place: the same
            line number in the same source schema document.</p></li>
            <li><p>Secondly, the new components must not change the semantics of existing
            components, if the existing components have already been used for validation purposes.
            The test whether components have been used is done at the level of a target
            namespace: if any declaration or definition in a target namespace has been
            used for validating a source document, or if it has been used when compiling
            a stylesheet or query, then the namespace is <b>sealed</b>, which means that its
            components must not be extended or redefined by any new components.
            We'll talk later about exactly what this means.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The main benefit of the global schema approach is that you can always be sure
        that type annotations in validated instance documents are consistent with types
        that are mentioned (or inferred) in compiled queries and stylesheets. If a query
        is compiled believing that element <i>E</i> will always be empty, then you can be sure
        that every validated instance of <i>E</i> will be empty, because no-one is allowed, between
        compilation and validation, to add a type definition that extends or redefines <i>E</i>
        allowing it to be non-empty. That's the theory, anyway.    
        </p>
        
        <p>The most obvious disadvantage of the approach is that an application can't
        work with two different versions of the same schema. If you want to write a stylesheet
        that transforms input documents from <i>V1</i> to <i>V2</i> of the same schema, you
        can't import both versions into the same stylesheet, one to validate the input and one
        to validated the output. In fact, you can't even have both versions in the same
        <code>Configuration</code> - which means you can't process an input collection containing
        a mix of different versions (or if you do, you have to forgo validation).</p>
        
        <p>There are other less obvious disadvantages. One of them is revealed by a recent
        embarrassing bug where we discovered that schema compilation isn't thread safe: you
        can't reliably run two schema compilations within a single <code>Configuration</code>
        at the same time. We've patched that by adding some locking, but it's an imperfect
        solution because the lock is rather coarse-grained. We need to find a better solution,
        and that gives us an opportunity to re-examine the design and see whether we can fix some
        other long-standing issues at the same time.</p>
        
        <p>Another outstanding issue is a long-standing bug #3531, concerning a situation where
        two independently-loaded schemas <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> both extend the same substitution
        group. This has remained outstanding because we have had no reports of users being affected
        by it; but it remains an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</p>
        
        <h2>The X+Y Problem</h2>
        
        <p>Suppose that <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are valid schemas. Then we've already seen
        that their union, which I will call <i>X+Y</i>, is not necessarily a valid schema;
        their declarations might be inconsistent. Apart from the obvious inconsistencies
        where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> contain different elements or types with the same name,
        there can be much more subtle inconsistencies:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p><i>Y</i> might contain a type that redefines a type in <i>X</i>.</p>
            <p>The semantics of <code>xs:redefine</code> as defined in XSD are a bit
            fuzzy round the edges, but the effect is supposed to be global: if a type
            is redefined, then all references to that type are affected. Exactly what
            happens when the same type is redefined more than once isn't made clear.
            </p>
            <p>The introduction of <code>xs:override</code> in XSD 1.1 makes this
            problem even worse, because <code>xs:override</code> allows existing
            definitions to be changed in completely arbitrary ways.</p></li>
            <li><p><i>Y</i> might contain a type that extends a type in <i>X</i>,
            by allowing additional child elements or attributes. To be valid, 
            instances that use the extended type have to identify themselves
            with an <code>xsi:type</code> attribute, but this doesn't alter the
            fact that adding the extended type to the global schema makes some
            things valid that were previously invalid. It's bad news if a document
            that was invalid at breakfast time suddenly becomes valid at tea time
            because a new schema has been added to the <code>Configuration</code>.
            It's even worse news if the schema changes during the course of
            validating an input document. </p></li>
            <li><p><i>Y</i> might contain an element declaration that
            adds to the substitution group of an element defined in <i>X</i>.
            Again, this means that a document that was invalid when validated
            against schema <i>X</i> becomes valid when validated against
            <i>X+Y</i>.</p></li>
            <li><p><i>X</i> might contain a wildcard, for example 
                <code>&lt;xs:any processContents="lax"/&gt;</code>. Suppose
            an instance document matches this wildcard with an element
            named <i>W</i>, and is valid (under the rules for lax validation)
            because the schema contains no element declaration for <i>W</i>.
            Now schema <i>Y</i> comes along and adds a definition for
            element <i>W</i>, and suddenly our source document is no
            longer valid.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It doesn't really help that all these situations are rare. Should the
        processor simply ignore the problem and hope it doesn't happen? For the first
        two cases above, Saxon prevents the situation occurring, which imposes an
        inconvenience on users who are actually doing something completely safe.
        For the final case (wildcards), Saxon ignores the problem, which creates
        the theoretical risk that queries and stylesheets are not type-safe: a document
        that has been validated against a type <i>T</i> might not satisfy all the contraints
        that the query or stylesheet processor assumes to be true for any valid instance
        of <i>T</i>.</p>
        
        <h2>An Alternative: Modular Schemas</h2>
        
        <p>Let's consider an alternative model, where instead of adding all schema
        components to a single global schema at <code>Configuration</code> level,
        we keep schemas independent and modular. So two stylesheets that import
        different schema documents have separate unrelated schemas, and there are
        no requirements that the two schemas should be consistent with each other.</p>
        
        <p>The challenge now is to ensure that a source document validated against
        a schema <i>S1</i> is consistent with a stylesheet that imports schema <i>S2</i>.
        If the two schemas are identical, there's no problem (and it's not too hard to
        detect that they are identical, for example if they load the same schema
        document as their starting point).</p>
        
        <p>But what if <i>S2</i> is a superset of <i>S1</i>? Suppose the document is
        validated against a schema with target namespace <i>X</i>, while the stylesheet
        has two <code>xsl:import-schema</code> declarations, for namespaces <i>X</i> 
        and <i>Y</i>? We're now back with the <i>X+Y</i> problem: a document that is valid
        against <i>X</i> is not necessarily valid against <i>X+Y</i>.</p>
        
        <p>It gets worse: if we have a pipeline of stylesheets, each of which imports
        schemas for both its input document and its output document, then the first
        stylesheet might import schemas for <i>X+Y</i>, and the second for <i>Y+Z</i>,
        and we need to be sure that when the first stylesheet validates its output against
        <i>X+Y</i>, the result will also be valid input against <i>Y+Z</i>.</p>
        
        <p>One possible solution here is to keep the imported schemas within a single
        stylesheet separate. Import one schema for the input, and another for the output,
        and don't require the two to be consistent. This also solves the problem of transforming
        from <i>V1</i> to <i>V2</i> of the same schema. So in our pipeline, the output
        of the first stylesheet would be validated not against <i>X+Y</i>, but merely
        against <i>Y</i>, which is the same schema used for the input of the second stylesheet.
        This would need language changes: <code>xsl:import-schema</code> declarations
        would need to identify which schema they belong to, and type names used in 
        <code>type</code> or <code>as</code> attributes would need to qualify the type
        name with a schema name.</p>
        
        <p>I've started doing work to allow free-standing schemas to be constructed
        and used for validation, independently of the <code>Configuration</code>.
        There are clearly cases where this is useful. However, there's a lot more
        work to be done on ensuring consistency of free-standing schemas, when a validated
        document is used as input to a schema-aware stylesheet or query. Expect a new
        class of (initially bewildering) error messages saying that element <i>E</i>
        is known to be valid against type <i>T</i> in schema <i>X</i>. but it isn't known
        to be valid against type <i>T</i> in schema <i>Y</i>. Hopefully these will be rare.</p>
        
        <h2>What about Wildcards?</h2>
        
        <p>I mentioned that there's an open issue with wildcards: if a schema type include
        a lax wildcard, then an element that's valid against that schema (because there's
        no element declaration matching the actual element name) can become invalid when
        more element declarations are added.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't the only issue with wildcards. XSD 1.1 allows you to say, for example
        <code>notQName="##defined"</code> which means that the name used for an element or
        attribute must be one that has no global declaration anywhere in the schema. That's
        another example of how adding new declarations to a schema can make existing content
        invalid.</p>
        
        <p>I think the answer to this problem is to interpret these definitions in the context
        of a "schema compilation unit". That is, when you compile a schema, 
            <code>notQName="##defined"</code> is interpreted as meaning "not a name used for
        a global element/attribute declaration in the that schema"; any
        names or declarations added later (by merging this schema with others) have no effect 
        on the meaning.</p>
        
        <p>This seems to solve the problem whether using a global schema or local free-standing
        schemas, and makes the two cases behave more consistently and predictably.</p>
