      <h1>Tuple types, and type aliases</h1>
      <p>I've been experimenting with some promising Saxon extensions.
         </p>
      <p>
         Maps and arrays greatly increase the flexibility and power of the XPath / XSLT / XQuery
         type system. But one drawback is that the type declarations can be very cumbersome,
         and very uninformative.
         </p>
      <p>
         Suppose you want to write a library to handle arithmetic on complex numbers. How are
         you going to represent a complex number? There are several possibilities: as a sequence
         of two doubles (<b>xs:double*</b>); as an array of two doubles (<b>array(xs:double)</b>), or as a map, for example <b>map{"r": 0.0e0, "i": 0.0e0}</b> (which has type <b>map(xs:string, xs:double)</b>).
         </p>
      <p>
         Note that whichever of these choices you make, (a) your choice is exposed to the user
         of your library by the way you declare the type in your function signatures, (b) the
         type allows many values that aren't legitimate representations of complex numbers,
         and (c) there's nothing in the type declaration that tells the reader of your code
         that this has anything to do with complex numbers.
         </p>
      <p>
         I think we can tackle these problems with two fairly simple extensions to the language.
         </p>
      <p>
         First, we can define type aliases. For XSLT, I have implemented an extension that
         allows you to declare (as a top-level element anywhere in the stylesheet):
         </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;saxon:type-alias name="complex"
                  type="map(xs:string, xs:double)"/&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
         and then you can use this type alias (prefixed by a tilde) anywhere an item type is
         allowed, for example
         </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;xsl:variable name="i" as="~complex" 
              select="cx:complex(0.0, 1.0)"/&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
         Secondly, we can define tuple types. So we can instead define our complex numbers
         as:
         </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;saxon:type-alias name="complex" 
                  type="tuple(r: xs:double, i: xs:double)"/&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>We're not actually introducing tuples here as a fundamental new type with their own
         set of functions and operators. Rather, a tuple declaration defines constraints on
         a map. It lists the keys that must be present in the map, and the type of the value
         to be associated with each key. The keys here are the strings "r" and "i", and in
         both cases the value must be an xs:double. The keys are always NCNames, which plays
         well with the map lookup notation M?K; if $c is a complex number, then the real and
         imaginary parts can be referenced as $c?r and $c?i respectively.
         </p>
      <p>
         For this kind of data structure, tuple types provide a much more precise constraint
         over the contents of the map than the current map type does. It also provides much
         better static type checking: an expression such as $c?i can be statically checked
         (a) to ensure that "i" is actually a defined field in the tuple declaration, and (b)
         that the expression is used in a context where an xs:double value is expected.
         </p>
      <p>
         I've been a little wary in the past of putting syntax extensions into Saxon; conformance
         to standards has always been a primary goal. But the standards process seems to be
         running out of steam, and I'm beginning to feel that it's time to push a few innovative
         ideas out in product to keep things moving forward. For those who would prefer to
         stick entirely to stuff defined by W3C, rest assured that these features will only
         be available if you explicitly enable extensions.
         </p>
