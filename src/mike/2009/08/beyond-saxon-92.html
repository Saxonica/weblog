      <h1>Beyond Saxon 9.2</h1>
      <p>So, Saxon 9.2 is finally out. I haven't had much chance to sit back and think yet
         - it's been a busy and stimulating week at the Balisage conference, and for some reason
         it's also been a busy week for technical support - it's probably imaginary, but I'm
         starting to think there's a pattern where immediately after you ship release N, you
         get a rush of bug reports on release N-1. The new release is looking reasonably sound,
         though I made an embarrassing faux pas in issuing duff license keys to several paying
         customers. If you're reading this, sorry!</p>
      <p>Regulars will know that I don't do planning, either of dates or facilities: I prefer
         to keep the programme completely flexible, so that I can always find room to put new
         things in if the opportunity presents itself. But it's worth thinking a little bit
         about what's on the to-do list.</p>
      <p>XSD 1.1 is now getting close to the finish line, and it makes sense to attempt a 100%
         conformant implementation. I think it's a useful and important spec, and despite the
         fact that nothing can ever really make XSD a thing of beauty, the new facilities will
         be very handy for those who can afford to take advantage of them. Also of course,
         the spec needs two working implementations to get to recommendation status, and Saxon
         is likely to be one of them. We're 80% of the way there already: I think the main
         things missing are xs:override and inheritable attributes, but there's also probably
         a bit of work to handle edge cases on assertions, union types, and a few other things.</p>
      <p>XQuery 1.1 is coming along, though it's not yet in the end-game. Saxon 9.2 implements
         a few important features from the spec, but there's more to do. There's a big challenge
         here because XQuery 1.1 is built very heavy on the concept of tuple streams, which
         is not something Saxon really has in its architecture at all. The 1.0 spec talks about
         them a lot, but there's only one case where they are actually needed, which is for
         some peculiar "order by" options that no-one actually uses; so the internal Saxon
         implementation is fairly bizarre and this will need to be changed. I fought quite
         hard against basing everything on tuples in the spec (it seems really odd to have
         the functionality designed around a concept that doesn't exist in the XDM data model),
         but I was a solitary voice. I don't especially enjoy implementing facilities that
         I would have designed differently, but conformance is king.</p>
      <p>Then there's XSLT 2.1 with its streaming facilities. We haven't even got a first draft
         of that out yet, but Saxon already implements some of the features. As the editor
         (in effect, lead designer) of the language it's very useful to be developing an imlementation
         in parallel - Norm Walsh made this point at Balisage in relationship to his XProc
         implementation, Calabash. I think there have to be some question marks about whether
         XSLT 2.1 will make it to the finishing line - the WG is short of resources and despite
         IBM having now shipped its XSLT 2.0 product, there's still a woeful shortage of implementors.
         Nevertheless, the new features are useful (streaming is proving to be a big selling
         point for Saxon-EE) and will be useful to the user community even if they only ever
         come out as Saxon extensions.</p>
      <p>What else? I'm not planning to implement XQuery full text or scripting extensions,
         unless there is a strong demand from the user community (or lots of money!), and I'm
         not going to stray into other areas like XProc - others can build that on top.</p>
      <p>There are always opportunities for performance work. </p>
      <p>Allowing compilation of XQuery to Java was an enormous amount of effort a couple of
         years ago, and it's been a bit of a disappointment: as far as I can tell, very few
         people are using it. And the performance gains are only modest (say 25%) which isn't
         enough to justify the inconvenience for most people. The message here is that everyone
         likes better performance, but few people are prepared to go far out of their way to
         achieve it. Usability comes first. I'd like to attempt some "just-in-time" compilation
         behind the scenes, say of predicates that are frequently evaluated. This might turn
         out to be less effort than the current code generation, since it only has to handle
         the 20% of the language used 80% of the time - when people stray outside that, you
         don't compile.</p>
      <p>There's one big optimization that isn't attempted yet, namely identification of common
         subexpressions. It shouldn't be too difficult: they have to be executed, of course,
         in the same static and dynamic context. Similarly (and perhaps with common code) there's
         scope for building a more intelligent decision tree for XSLT pattern matching by avoiding
         repeated evaluation of predicates that appear in more than one pattern.</p>
      <p>When I looked earlier this year at Saxon vs XSLTC performance (see previous blog postings),
         I was struck that XSLTC performs better than Saxon on a "null" transformation, where
         it discards all the input and does nothing. That can't be due to compiling: it must
         mean that there is less context-switching overhead between the XML parser and the
         transformation engine. Perhaps they are using private knowledge or interfaces into
         Xerces, I don't know. I need to resume conversations with Tatu Saloranta to see whether
         we can do some tight integration between Saxon and his XML parser technology.</p>
      <p>Other things on the performance agenda are some kind of multithreading to take advantage
         of multi-core CPUs, and some re-engineering of the NamePool to reduce contention in
         high throughput workloads.</p>
      <p>No doubt there are many things I've forgotten here, or not thought about yet, which
         will come up during development. If there are burning things you need, let me know.</p>
