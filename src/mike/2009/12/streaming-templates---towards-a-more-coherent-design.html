      <h1>Streaming templates - towards a more coherent design</h1>
      <p>
         
         As previously reported, I've been making good progress in the last few weeks in implementing
         streaming templates: that is, the ability to write an XSLT stylesheet using template
         rules, in which the templates are activated in response to events notified by a SAX-style
         push parser, without ever building a tree in memory. I've been gradually increasing
         the range of expressions that can be handled in such templates to include a large
         number of the more common constructs, including flow-of-control constructs like <code>xsl:for-each</code> and<code>xsl:choose</code> which end up needing rather special treatment.</p>
      <p>However, there's something a little unsatisfactory about the state of play. Every
         time I write a new test case, there's a 50% chance I have to change the code to make
         it work. At this stage of the game, that's too high: it suggests the design is not
         yet robust enough, and unless it is made more robust, there will be a lot of bugs
         in the finished product, because there is a limit to how many test cases I can write.
         There's a smell about it, which suggests I need to stop frantically coding to fix
         each new bug, and step back to think about the design.</p>
      <p>At the heart of the problem is the fact that the design is not sufficiently composable.
         A template body is essentially an expression tree (we can ignore the fact that it
         derives from two different languages, XSLT and XPath - the compiled expression tree
         does not reflect this distinction once operations such as variable and function inlining
         have taken place). We need a model where any expression can take any other expressions
         as its arguments, subject only to the streamability rules, and that means we need
         a clearly-defined and universal protocol for passing the results of one expression
         to another. </p>
      <p>In the non-streaming case this protocol is the SequenceIterator class, an iterator
         which delivers a sequence of items (and there's also an optimized protocol which delivers
         a singleton item where both sides agree to use it). We also have the ability to evaluate
         expressions in push mode, where an expression pushes its results as a sequence of
         events to a Receiver; it can evaluate its subexpressions either by "pull" as a SequenceIterator,
         or by asking the subexpression to push its results to the same or a different Receiver. </p>
      <p>For the streaming evaluation, a similar set of protocols is emerging, but they aren't
         as well formalised, and currently not every expression supports every protocol, which
         means that arbitrary composition of expressions isn't working.</p>
      <p>Generally in a streamable template there will be one path through the expression tree
         that accepts streamed input. For exampleconsider the template body:</p>
      <p><code>&lt;xsl:template match="e"&gt;</code><br /><code>  &lt;abc att="{@x + 5}"&gt;</code><br /><code>     &lt;xsl:copy-of select="doc('xyz')//data[value=current()/@y]"/&gt;</code><br /><code>     &lt;xsl:value-of select="count(.//g)+2"/&gt;</code><br /><code>  &lt;/abc&gt;</code><br /><code>&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></p>
      <p>Here there is a "basic streamed input" represented by the selection <code>.//g</code>. This is fed into a count() function, whose result is then fed into an arithmetic
         expression, whose result in turn is fed into a simple-content-constructor (represented
         by the select attribute of xsl:value-of, and whose semantics are the rules for "constructing
         simple content" in the XSLT 2.0 specification). The result of the simple content constructor
         is a string, which is fed into the <code>xsl:value-of</code> instruction to create a text node, which is fed into the complex-content-constructor
         represented by the body of the <code>&lt;abc&gt;</code> literal result element, whose result is in turn fed into the result of the template
         itself. The expressions have other inputs as well, but these are evaluated conventionally
         in non-streaming mode and need not concern us, except to note that in some cases their
         results must be combined with the results of the streamed inputs.</p>
      <p>What exactly do we mean by the basic streamed input? It's essentially the largest
         subexpression that reads from the streamed input document
         and whose syntax is that of a streamed pattern. A streamed pattern is capable of examining
         events on the fly and deciding whether
         they correspond to nodes that match the pattern or not. The rules for what you can
         write in a streamed pattern are quite close to the rules for what you can write in
         an XSLT match pattern, but not identical: they allow some things not allowed in XSLT
         match patterns, such as "." which matches the context item, and they disallow some
         other things, such as arbitrary navigation in the filter expressions. An important
         difference is that they are anchored to a context node: the XSLT pattern <code>child::a</code> will match any &lt;a&gt; element regardless of context, whereas a streamed pattern <code>child::a</code> will only match &lt;a&gt; elements that are children of the context node.</p>
      <p>In the particular case above, once count() has done its work the rest of the code
         ought to be able to work in much the same way as it does today, because the result
         of count() is a singleton. The count() function itself needs to be evaluated in streaming
         mode because we don't want to buffer its input in memory. Currently Saxon is evaluating
         the code above this point in two halves: the &lt;abc&gt; start tag and its att attribute
         are written before the descendants of the context node arrive from the XML parser,
         while the text node and end tag are written afterwards. This works, but isn't really
         necessary: because the count() is a singleton, it could be evaluated at the start,
         placed in a variable, and the rest of the template body could then be evaluated "conventionally"
         taking its input from this variable when required.</p>
      <p>This strategy works well when there is a streaming result that is a singleton, but
         it can also be used as a fallback when there is an expression on the tree that expects
         a sequence as its input, but for which no streamed implementation is available. For
         example, let's suppose that in the above example, count(.//g) is replaced by <code>index-of(.//g, 'q')</code>, and that no streamed implementation of index-of is yet available. We don't want
         to fail at this point. Note that the compiled expression is actually <code>index-of(data(.//g), 'q')</code> where the <code>data()</code> function represents the implicit atomization. We do have a streaming implementation
         of <code>data(.//g)</code>: this will have to buffer its results into a variable, so that it can be made available
         to the unstreamed <code>index-of()</code> function in the form it expects, as a (pull-style) SequenceIterator.</p>
      <p>This approach means that during the time we have not yet developed streaming implementations
         of all expressions and functions, users will only notice less-than-optimal performance,
         they won't get failures. So this is an important part of getting the design more robust.</p>
      <p>Let's now look at the protocols for expressions that actually are streamed.</p>
      <p>There's a large class of expressions that can usefully take a sequence of items as
         a streamed input, and produce another sequence of items as its streamed output. Examples
         are functions such as distinct-values(), subsequence(), and index-of(), and expressions
         such as filter expressions (a[b]). Some of these like distinct-values() might require
         some working memory, but it's still useful to stream them.</p>
      <p>In my paper at Balisage 2009 I identified two kinds of stream that can be used (whether
         we're in a pull or push pipeline): a composed stream is a sequence of items (atomic
         values and nodes), while a decomposed stream is a sequence of parser events (startElement,
         endElement, etc). A mixed stream may contain both: for example the result of the expression
         &lt;a&gt;{b}&lt;/a&gt; (I'll use XQuery notation for conciseness) might be produced as a startElement
         event, followed by a sequence of composed element nodes, followed by an endElement
         event. Depending on what happens to the result of this expression, the recipient might
         either choose to compose it (into a single element node), or to decompose it (into
         a stream of events, for example to be sent to the serializer).</p>
      <p>The Saxon Receiver interface currently handles mixed or decomposed streams in push
         mode. There is no push-style interface specialized for handling composed sequences,
         corresponding to the SequenceIterator interface in pull mode. Because many expressions
         can usefully pass their data in this way, I've been introducing such an interface
         (called Feed), but it's not yet universally or systematically supported.</p>
      <p>But although a composed Feed will be a useful protocol to support between streaming
         expressions, it doesn't handle all cases.</p>
      <p>At the bottom level, the events coming from the parser can be handled in a number
         of ways.</p>
      <p>Some functions, such as count(), exists(), data(), and string() can process these
         events directly to generate an item or sequence of items. We'll call these "watching
         operations". They sit on the push pipeline between the parser and the rest of the
         expression evaluation machinery, turning decomposed parse events into composed items.
         There input is the basic streamed input expression, and their output is a sequence
         of items. In some cases they take additional
         inputs beyond the streamed input: one expression that's proving particularly troublesome
         in this regard is the simple-content-constructor, because of the messy work that it
         has to do combining adjacent text nodes and inserting separators. We basically want
         to have as small a set of watching operations as possible, because they are the most
         complex to write. Fortunately a great many expressions work on atomized input, so
         once we have implemented data() as a watching expression, a lot of other things become
         possible.</p>
      <p>It's not always ideal for watching operations to produce a composed sequence as their
         result. Consider for example <code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;xsl:copy-of select=".//g"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Here the watching operation is the xsl:copy-of. This shouldn't materialise the &lt;g&gt;
         elements as trees in memory: it should just feed a decomposed sequence of startElement
         and endElement events to the Receiver used as the destination of the literal result
         element.</p>
      <p>So what's emerging is the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Every expression must be able to take a feed (a composed sequence of items in push
            mode) as its input (for any of its arguments) and to deliver its results as a feed.</li>
         <li>For some expressions, this capability can be provided by a general-purpose wrapper
            around the existing expression implementation, which buffers the contents of the feed
            and delivers it via the SequenceIterator interface. This provides a transition route
            so that streaming will work with any expression; "native streaming" implementations
            of the more exotic expressions can then be developed incrementally.</li>
         <li>In addition to this capability, some basic expressions must be implemented so they
            can be evaluated as "watching expressions": instead of taking their input as a feed
            of composed items, these match events coming from the parser. Some expressions must
            be implemented this way (data(), string(), xsl:copy-of); for other expressions (count(),
            exists()) this can be seen as an optional optimization.</li>
         <li>For some expressions, notably those that construct element nodes, either directly
            or by calling subexpressions (e.g.<code>xsl:apply-templates</code>, <code>xsl:for-each</code>, <code>xsl:choose</code>) it is more efficient to deliver the result as a decomposed stream of events. This
            protocol will be used only where the receiving expression wants the data in this form
            and where the supplying expression is able to deliver it in this form (alternatively,
            if the receiving expression wants a decomposed sequence and the supplier is not able
            to deliver it, a decomposer will be interserted in the pipeline to turn the composed
            result into a decomposed result).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is not a million miles from what the current code is doing. But until writing
         this, I hadn't stood back and formulated the rules. I think I've now got a set of
         design principles in place that can be applied to the implementation of individual
         streaming expressions to ensure full composability of the constructs that can be used
         in a streamed template. I'll know I've got it right when I start expecting new test
         cases to work first time.<br />
