      <h1>The first Saxon deadlock</h1>
      <p>
         
         For the first time ever, I hit a deadlock in Saxon. It was with the current development
         version, fortunately, rather than in the field, though it's had me thinking about
         whether the code in 9.2 is entirely safe in this area. </p>
      <p>In Saxon 9.2 there's only one place where Saxon uses multiple threads: namely in the
         "streaming copy" facility where one thread is splitting the incoming document into
         small chunks and the other thread is processing those chunks one by one. It's here
         that the deadlock occurred, though it's a bigger risk in future because Saxon 9.3
         will allow evaluation of a for-each loop in parallel if users request it. </p>
      <p>The deadlock occurred with evaluation of global variables. These are evaluated lazily,
         and a change I made when introducing multi-threaded for-each loops is that when Saxon
         decides it has to evaluate a global variable, it synchronizes on the Bindery which
         is where all the global variables are held. This avoids two threads evaluating the
         same global variable at the same time, which would not actually be fatal in most cases,
         though it could be expensive when evaluating a global variable is 90% of the entire
         transformation, as sometimes happens. The reason it synchronizes is that there's a
         flag for each global variable indicating whether it is currently being evaluated;
         this flag is used for detection of circularities where evaluating A causes evaluation
         of B which in turn causes evaluation of A. Such circularities cannot (always) be statically
         detected in XSLT because the dependency might be via an xsl:apply-templates call.
         Without the synchronisation (my reasoning probably was), a circularity could be wrongly
         reported because a two concurrent evaluations of the same variable could now happen
         not because of a circularity, but because of multithreaded evaluation. </p>
      <p>But the problem is that this lock on the Bindery can be held for quite a long time,
         and in particular, it can be held by a thread that is waiting for input from another
         thread, thus leading to the deadlock that I found in testing. </p>
      <p>So, what's the answer? Firstly, we can avoid using the "is-being-evaluated" flag in
         the Bindery for detection of circularities, and replace it with a stack of global
         variables currently-being-evaluated held in the XPathContext object; the circularity
         error then triggers if you try to evaluate a variable that is already on the stack.
         This eliminates the possibility of interference with/by the evaluation of global variables
         going on in other threads. </p>
      <p>How do we then prevent two threads evaluating the same global variable? This is something
         we still want to avoid, for various reasons: as already discussed, evaluating some
         globals might take a seriously long time; some globals (such as select="doc('a.xml')")
         are complicated because they create entries in the shared document pool; and some
         invoke extension functions that might have side-effects. First thought is to have
         a Lock object per global variable, and a thread that decides to evaluate the global
         variable synchronizes on this Lock object. However this is not deadlock free in the
         event of circular dependencies. Consider the situation where A depends on B and B
         depends on A: one thread might attempt to evaluate A and grab A's lock, while the
         other starts with B and grabs B's lock; the two threads would deadlock against each
         other before either detected the circularity. If Java synchronization allowed one
         to detect and recover from deadlocks this would be an elegant way of detecting the
         circularity; but sadly, it doesn't. </p>
      <p>Of course, there's a lot of support in Java for more sophisticated concurrency control
         than simple synchronization: various implementations of Lock, Semaphore, and the like.
         However, none of them seem to do quite what's needed. My current thought is that as
         well as each thread holding a stack of global-variables-under-evaluation, as discussed
         above, there should be a shared object holding the dependency graph among all global
         variables (accessed, of course, under synchronisation); before attempting to evaluate
         a global variable, the thread should not just check whether that variable is already
         on its stack, but rather whether evaluating it would create a cycle in the global
         dependency graph. Of course, that's equivalent to doing the deadlock detection "by
         hand". </p>
      <p>I haven't made final decisions yet, so all ideas are welcome. </p>
      <p>Is there a problem in Saxon 9.2? There won't be any deadlocks, because evaluation
         of variables isn't synchronized. However, I think there is a possible risk of false
         detection of circularities. The consequences of this aren't life-threatening, so I
         think we can probably wait and see whether it happens. </p>
      <p>POSTSCRIPT: I've found the "stack of global variables currently being evaluated" already
         exists: when the context changes, a new context object is created, chained to the
         previous one, with a link to the instruction being evaluated when the context object
         is created; searching down this chain provides the information required to detect
         circular dependencies among variables.

               <div class="commentBody">Hi, <br />can you give me an example how to reproduce such a deadlock? <br />i think we have such deadlocks in our Java webapplication. Very rarely - but they
                  exist.<br />
                  After 2 days of firing millions of requests to Tomcat with Apache JMeter i reproduced
                  it 5 or 6 times. <br />(full CPU load and LamdaProbe shows two open connections). the only solution is a
                  tomcat restart<br />
                  We use Saxon 9.2.0.6 PE<br />
                  thank you for any hint, we are searching this bug for months! <br /></div>

               <div class="commentBody">If you're using Saxon-PE, then there is no multithreading going on, so no possibility
                  of deadlock. Whatever the problem is, it's not this. Please use the Sourceforge help
                  list for help if you want to use a public list, or the email address provided to customers
