      <h1>Peer-to-Patent: should I take part?</h1>
      <p>I received last week an invitation to review a patent application, under the pilot
         (and strangely-named) peer-to-patent scheme whereby anyone who might be thought to
         be interested is invited to comment on patent applications during their examination
         by the patent office. The specific patent in question is at http://www.peertopatent.org/patent/20100250576/overview:
         it's a Microsoft application for an optimization technique for SPARQL queries. </p>
      <p>First question I have to ask myself is, should I take part? Intrinsically, it feels
         like sleeping with the enemy. It seems a very strange process, exploiting the willingness
         of the intellectual community to share knowledge in order to improve a process whose
         very purpose is the antithesis - to assign monopolies of knowledge. Do I want to participate
         in a process that might encourage the authorities to award fewer bad patents? Or do
         I think that bad patents are ultimately a good thing, because they will inevitably,
         in time, bring down the whole system? There are issues of tactics here, and issues
         of high moral principles. I'm going to compromise: I will respond telling them I refuse
         to take part in the process, but they can read my blog here for my views on the patent
         application if they want them. </p>
      <p>Another little tactical point: apparently in the US, software engineers are routinely
         advised not to read patents, on the grounds that the fine for infringing a patent
         is trebled if you knew about it. I don't know if that's really true - I find it hard
         to believe that in the land of the free, you can be fined for reading information
         that's in the public domain. If it is true, it makes me proud to be non-American.
         Anyway, I can hardly claim ignorance of a patent that I've been invited to review,
         so I'll take the plunge and click on the link; fortunately it turns out to be of little
         relevance to anything I'm doing in my products. </p>
      <p>First observation on the patent application (and others I have seen recently) is that
         it's much more readable than the applications of ten years ago. I don't think it uses
         the giveaway patent-speak word "plurality" even once. It's written by a software engineer,
         not a patent-lawyer trying to make it unreadable to other software engineers. That
         can only be a good thing. It also hardly tries to disguise the fact that it's a pure
         software patent. There's a bit of nonsense in the claims about patenting the media
         on which the software is written, but no serious pretence that the patent applies
         to a machine rather than to pure algorithms. It seems that in the US at least, you
         no longer have to pretend that it's not about software in order to get your patent
         application through. </p>
      <p>What about the substance? I'm told that the two ways a patent claim can be challenged
         are on the grounds of "obviousness" or on the grounds of "prior art" (i.e., someone
         else has done substantially the same thing before). I'm afraid I really don't know
         enough about how these tests are supposed to be applied. Wikipedia tells me that "obvious"
         means "obvious to one with ordinary skills in the art" and interprets that as someone
         with "the normal skills and knowledge in a particular technical field, without being
         a genius." Well, if that means obvious to the average programmer, then the stuff in
         this patent certainly isn't obvious. If it means obvious to the average person doing
         research or implementation in logic-based query languages, then it almost certainly
         is. I'm not working wit logic-based query languages, but it looks to me like the kind
         of solution I would immediately come up with if I were faced with this problem. The
         "naive solution" to the problem that they claim to be improving on is a strawman;
         you would have to be very ordinary to think that was the best you could do. </p>
      <p>As to prior art, again, I don't know enough about how this is evaluated. Does someone
         have to be tackling exactly the same problem and coming up with exactly the same solution
         to qualify as prior art? Or can one simply point out that this is just a specific
         example of a general approach that has been used by competent programmers for decades? </p>
      <p>This patent application points to all that is wrong with the patent system. It's a
         simple solution to a simple problem. It's impossible to say whether it's original,
         and it's impossible to say whether it's obvious. But what one can say with certainty
         is that there is no way it is in the public interest to give Microsoft a 25-year monolopy
         on solving this particular little problem in this particular way. Anyone who thinks
         doing that is going to encourage innovation needs their head examining.

               <div class="commentBody">I know what a "monopsony" is but not a "monolopy" though feel it must have something
                  to do with rabbits, somehow.<br />
                  More seriously, it is at least good news that this patent is readable. I tried to
                  read one from the late 1980s a year or so ago and couldn't make much sense of it.
                  This is mildly embarrassing as I wrote it, at least the version before the patent
                  lawyer mangled it. (I suspect our paths to work crossed at the time as I lived in
                  Reading and worked on Nine Mile Ride.)<br />
                  Still, I think it's a pity not to comment formally on this patent application. If
                  there are even one or two comments from reasonably knowledgeable people saying "obvious"
                  it will be very difficult to sustain the patent. If a lot of applications of this
                  sort get shot down then maybe the whole system can be tidied up eventually.<br />
                  Personally, I don't think software patents are necessarily evil: there might be a
                  very few cases a decade where patents might actually be justified. I'm thinking of
                  some cryptographic algorithms, for example, where there's some real insight and work
                  in testing the results. On the other hand, if the system is incapable of distinguishing
                  these from the mere "nuisance" patents then we'd probably be better off, on balance,
                  with no patents at all.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Ed: A monolope is plainly an antelope with only one horn; and I'm sure you can figure
                  out what a postlope is.<br />
                  Michael: I find your attitude disturbingly similar to that of 19th- and 20th-century
                  revolutionary leftist parties in the West, who were always opposed to anything that
                  could improve the lives of the workers, on the grounds that it would only delay the
                  inevitable Revolution. Well, maybe so; but people must live in the meantime. If revolution
                  or a collapse of the patent system were truly inevitable, there might be some justification
                  (though I doubt it) for such an attitude. But the patent system, like the monarchy
                  with which it is intimately connected historically, is old and strong, and has survived
                  centuries of drastic changes by itself changing.<br />
                  In addition, there is an equivoque on "improve the process". In the sense of improving
                  the *efficiency* of the process, it's already been improved immensely: getting a patent
                  is far easier than before, though still slow and monstrously expensive. What is at
                  stake here is improving the *rectitude* of the process, so that the only patents that
                  are granted are those that are truly novel.<br />
                  As for the treble damages, they do indeed exist. The idea is that knowing and willful
                  infringement is much worse than mere ignorant infringement, and you can't be a knowing
                  and willful infringer if you didn't know the patent existed. When dealing with strategic
                  behavior, you are often better off if it is known that you do not know certain things.
                  If you drive an armored car carrying a safe full of valuables, for example, you will
                  prefer not to know the combination of the safe, so that (a) you cannot be suspected
                  if the safe is emptied, and (b) no hijacker can get the combination out of you by
                  unpleasant means.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Not sure if that was intended as a criticism of my grammar? I don't know how one justifies
                  "I need my shoes mending", but as colloquial usage I hear it quite often. And in this
                  kind of writing, the occasional colloquialism can make the piece less dry.</div>
