      <h1>Cutting Saxon down to size</h1>
      <p>It's clear that in cross-compiling Saxon to Javascript to run on the browser, reducing
         the size of the code could make a major impact on the performance and therefore usability
         of the resulting product. So I've been thinking about how one might achieve a radical
         reduction in the size. Rather like an incoming Chancellor faced with a record budget
         deficit, I've been trying to think the unthinkable to see where one might make savage
         cuts. </p>
      <p>It's instructive to compare Saxon 9.3 with Saxon 5.0, released in December 1999 as
         the first fully-compliant implementation of XSLT 1.0. Saxon 5.0 was 17K non-comment
         lines of code; Saxon-HE 9.3 is 143K, and Saxon-EE 9.3 is 210K. (The ratio of comment
         to non-comment lines, incidentally, has remained steady at roughly 1:1). </p>
      <p>Let's look at an example: the substring function, which is unchanged between XSLT
         1.0 and XSLT 2.0. In Saxon 9.3, there's about 200 lines of Saxon-HE code to implement
         this function, plus 30 lines in EE to support compilation of XQuery to Java: there
         isn't any specific support for streaming, though there is for many other similar functions.
         In Saxon 5.0 the size of the code is 40 lines, plus 12 lines to support the rudimentary
         compile-to-Java facility that was present in that release, and later abandoned. In
         AJAXSLT, an abortive 2005 attempt by Steffen Meschkat to write an XSLT processor in
         Javascript, the substring function is implemented in 17 lines of code. In Henry Lindquist's
         2008 XPath.js implementation of XPath 1.0, this is the implementation, in its entirety,
         formatted for readability: </p>
      <p>XPath.substring=function(s,i,l){ <br />s=this.string(s); <br />i=Math.round(this.number(i))-1; <br />return(arguments.length==2)?s.substr(i&lt;0?0:i):s.substr(i&lt;0?0:i,Math.round(this.number(l))-Math.max(0,-i)); <br />}; </p>
      <p>How do these implementations differ? </p>
      <p>Firstly, even the early 1999 version of Saxon (unlike either of the Javascript versions)
         supported Unicode astral planes (characters above 65535) properly; it also included
         rudimentary code to supply static type information. That meant it didn't use Java's
         substring() method. The code was also split into methods to support use in a run-time
         library called from compiled code. It could easily be reduced to 20 lines and still
         have full Unicode support. </p>
      <p>In the 9.3 version of the code, we see first some compile-time optimization, designed
         to avoid conversions of arguments from integer to double and then back to integers.
         Then we find that the 2-argument form of the function and the 3-argument form are
         separately implemented; and there are separate paths for the case when the arguments
         are integers rather than doubles, and for the case where the the input string is known
         to contain no astral characters (in which case the function can be implemented using
         the Java substring() method). It is also careful in this case to mark the output string
         as containing no astral characters, so that the consumer of the string can make similar
         optimizations downstream. </p>
      <p>In short, the code is ten times bigger than it needs to be, to achieve tiny speed
         improvements which in the case of client-side execution will never pay for the cost
         of the extra code that needs to be downloaded. (In Javascript, the assumption that
         integer arithmetic is faster than double probably needs to be reversed anyway.) Extrapolated
         across the product as a whole, this suggests that radical cuts are indeed possible. </p>
      <p>I have already cut the size of the code base for the GWT compilation from about 145K
         non-comment lines (in Saxon-HE 9.3) to under 80K, by cutting out unwanted functionality
         such as XQuery, updates, serialization, support for JAXP, Java extension functions,
         JDOM, etc etc. This study of the implementation of one function suggests that 40K
         ought to be achievable, given enough effort. That's consistent with the figure of
         17K lines for Saxon 5.0, on the basis that XSLT 2.0 as a language is about twice the
         size of XSLT 1.0. </p>
      <p>Where might we look for these savings? </p>
      <p>The GWT compiler reports show that a significant proportion of the compiled Javascript
         contains string literals. A lot of these are data: character tables supporting Unicode
         normalization, case conversion, validation of XML characters, and regular expression
         handling. I've already ditched the case conversion code in favour of using Javascript's
         own version of the same - it's probably not 100% conformant to the XPath requirements
         in corner cases, but I doubt anyone will notice. The Unicode normalization tables
         are a vast amount of data to support one rarely-used function, normalize-unicode()
         - the obvious thing to do here is to put the data in a separate file on the server
         and download it only when it's needed. The data for validating XML characters can
         be halved by removing support for XML 1.1 (or for XML 1.0, take your pick). More radically,
         perhaps we can check whether a name is a valid name by exploiting functionality already
         available in the Javascript platform - if it's a valid name, then it's a valid XPath
         1.0 expression, so we could throw it at an XPath 1.0 parser to find out. I'm not sure
         I would trust the answer (all the signs are that impementors take short cuts with
         conformance in this kind of environment), but perhaps I need to pick up a bit of that
         culture. </p>
      <p>For regular expressions, Saxon currently parses the regex against the XPath rules,
         and translates it to a Java regex. The "obvious" thing to do is to change that code
         as necessary to generate a Javascript regex instead. (I've already retargeted the
         code to use the Javascript RegExp class). The JS RegExp library doesn't support Unicode
         properly ("." matches a 16-bit UCS code point, not a Unicode character), so I would
         have to resurrect the JDK1.4 version of this code which handled the differences. But
         I'm not sure this is the right thing to do. Most people wouldn't complain if I simply
         offered Javascript regular expressions instead of XPath regular expressions. I'm not
         comfortable with that level of non-conformance myself, but I do think there is room
         here to find a more pragmatic balance. </p>
      <p>As regards optimization, it's quite hard to know what code one can reasonably discard.
         There's a lot of static type-checking logic, which has significant benefits in terms
         of diagnostics as well as optimization; I don't think it's right to discard all of
         this, but some of the more complex analysis can probably be simplified. The best thing
         is probably to chip away at it on a case-by-case basis. I want to reduce the "instruction
         set" of the compiled code, that is the number of different kinds of Expression that
         the compiler/optimizer generate. Some of these are used in only very specialized circumstances;
         some could be combined with other expressions. </p>
      <p>Saxon goes to a fair bit of trouble to ensure that the original stylesheet tree isn't
         needed at execution time. That involves copying data over from the stylesheet tree
         to the expression tree. This seems rather pointless in the browser environment. There's
         a lot of administrative overhead in maintaining things like line numbers for diagnostics
         that will be little use in the browser (because the XML parser doesn't supply line
         number information in the first place), so it should go. There's also code that unnecessarily
         generalized because the requirements of XSLT and XQuery are different. The whole apparatus
         for function binding is looking vastly over-engineered for a world in which every
         function call is either a system function, a constructor function for a built-in type,
         or a user-defined stylesheet function. </p>
      <p>So there are plenty of candidates. But as with the Chancellor's cuts, it's important
         to avoid becoming obsessive: there's a law of diminishing returns here. </p>
      <p>Also, the size of the download doesn't depend only on the size of the Saxon source
         code: it also depends on the libraries that are included. Adding in GWT's support
         for the HTML DOM (which is quite separate from the XML DOM) appears to have bloated
         the download size very substantially. I need to look at whether it's possible to avoid
         that or reduce its impact.

               <div class="commentBody">Do you actually have evidence for that view even on the JVM? Raw floating-point and
                  integer arithmetic are usually about equally fast on modern CPUs, and Perl is certainly
                  performant, even though it does all arithmetic in float unless integer processing
                  is explicitly enabled. My guess would be that the conditional processing overwhelms
                  any remaining difference between int and float.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Actually, I wasn't really thinking about the cost of floating point arithmetic, but
                  the cost of repeated conversion between integers, floating-point, and strings, which
                  can happen an awful lot if you're not careful. I've no idea of the overall significance:
                  one of the problems is that Saxon has accumulated a vast number of small local optimizations,
                  most of which were probably justified at some stage by measurements on some particular
                  use case, but which may now contribute very little in the overall scheme of things.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Hi Michael ¶I've seen your post and tweets the last couple of weeks and the work your
                  doing on
                  trying to bring Saxon to the browser. I'm not sure how aware your are of this but
                  JavaScript are not to be found only on the browser side and at the moment JavaScript
                  are really picking up on the server side also. JavaScript are starting to be pretty
                  powerful on the server and there are may advantages by having one language on both
                  the server and the client. ¶Again, I'm not sure how aware you are of this but the
                  popularity of JavaScript on
                  the server are mainly due to the surface of node.js: http://nodejs.org/ ¶Node are
                  a truly scalable, single treaded and non-blocking event server. It have gained
                  a lot of interest due to this. Douglas Crockford (creator of JSON and architect at
                  Yahoo) have a great talk where he talks about what makes Node a good application server:
                  http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/08/30/yui-theater-douglas-crockford-crockford-on-javascript-scene-6-loopage-52-min/ ¶I
                  must say; I would love to see Saxon coming to Node. And maybe to Node first...</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Thanks for the reference, but I don't think there's any good reason to move the server

                  sofware package in a language with no strong typing and no integer arithmetic horrifies
                  me. Javascript has some very nice features and I'm sure I'll warm to it as I get to

               <div class="commentBody">For anyone who hasn't read it, I highly recommend "JavaScript: The Good Parts," also
                  by Douglas Crockford and published by O'Reilly. It's a short read and looks good on
                  a Kindle (or other e-reader). ¶It's a great book out for those who haven't quite decided
                  whether they like the unique
                  taste of JavaScript's linguistic Kool-Aid. (One of the surprising things about JavaScript
                  is how successful programmers can be without really understanding the language.) ¶Besides
                  being a fellow Yahoo, I first saw Mr. Crockford give a talk on his book at
                  a functional programming interest group a few years back. At the time, I had the usual
                  feelings about JavaScript: kinda hacky, weird typing, global variables, the DOM is
                  terrible ... yuck. He changed my mind. ¶JavaScript, for better or worse, is the most
                  widely used programming language in the
                  world. The work being done on JavaScript optimization is massive (and fairly interesting
                  if you're the type of person who finds clever JIT techniques interesting). ¶I think
                  we're approaching a point where any engineer who doesn't really understand
                  JavaScript is in danger of falling behind. ¶PS: If you don't understand why JavaScript
                  would be a featured topic at a functional
                  programming interest group, you owe it to yourself to find out.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">HI,<br />It is very nice to hear that Saxon will be also in JS!<br />I am also interested reducing the size of Saxon HE. Would you so kind to share what
                  classes can be removed (for tests, related to Saxon EE/PE), so that to keep Saxon
                  HE fully functional as to XQuery, XSLT, and XPath?<br />Thank you,<br />Claudius Teodorescu</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Hi Mike!¶I really appreciate the effort and I'd really prefer to use a fat saxon.js
                  than some
                  other half-baked solution.<br />What I always treasured Saxon for is the completeness of the features, it really saves
                  a lot of headaches to have a bug-free implementation.¶The only other thing that I
                  would recommend is that you release an alpha of your GWT
                  build asap so that people can try it out.<br />To be honest, I didn't do much XSL client-side, but having a downloadable js implementation,
                  would be awesome for many of my use cases</div>
