      <h1>TPAC: The Morning After</h1>
      <p>I'm feeling very angry with myself this morning - angry that I wasn't angry yesterday,
         during the TPAC plenary meeting. Angry that no-one else was angry; as several people
         remarked from the platform, it was an incredibly quiet meeting with almost no public
         dissent. And yet we should all be furious.</p>
      <p>Yesterday the browser vendors showed us some cool stuff that we will soon be able
         to do on the web. Text that runs at an angle, boxes with round corners, logos that
         spin, graphics that pulse to the beat of the music, forms that (wow!) check that you've
         entered a valid date. And everyone tweeted "Wow, that's cool". Well, it's not cool.
         It's a tragedy, and I'm angry about it.</p>
      <p>What we saw yesterday was the crudest possible demonstration of the power base of
         the browser vendors. We don't get to decide whether users can see boxes with round
         corners or logos that spin - the browser vendors get to decide it. They get to decide
         what date formats we can use when filling in forms. They get to decide that we can
         use ABCnotation but not MusicXML, which means we can listen to folk music but not
         to classical music. Sure, the browser is programmable; but they've decided we can
         write any program we like so long as it's in Javascript. What about people who want
         to write client-side software in XSLT 2.0? The browser vendors get to decide whether
         that's cool or not. What about people who want to do linked data using RDF? The browser
         vendors decide.</p>
      <p>For twenty years this industry was dominated by IBM. Their dominance was broken by
         the open systems movement; but instead of the open systems movement taking control,
         they allowed Microsoft to take over the seat of power while no-one was watching. Then
         for twenty years Microsoft controlled our destiny, until the open source movement
         once again gave the community some influence over its own future. What we saw yesterday
         is that control is now in the hands of a cabal of four or five browser vendors who
         between them are going to decide the experience that billions of people will get from
         the web. They are the style police, they decide what's cool: they decide what kind
         of typographical effects we can see, what kind of music we can listen to, what kind
         of programming language we can write in.</p>
      <p>We should be angry about it, and I'm ashamed that yesterday, no-one was. Like crowds
         saluting a great dictator, everyone just parroted "Wow, cool, man!". We hummed their
         tune. W3C, who should be championing the openness of the web, instead allowed the
         junta to take the platform. I should have got up and had a rant from the microphone,
         and all I managed was a lonely tweet. Sorry: I let you down.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, enjoy playing with your new toys. Those in charge are hoping they will
         keep you quiet.</p>

               <div class="commentBody">There's no reason to limit yourself to browser vendors really. In my opinion every
                  application should become a browser. See for example Beatnik, the Semantic Address
                  Book https://sommer.dev.java.net/AddressBook.html<br />
                  Now what is interesting is if you look at apps such as Tweetdeck, Nambu, etc is why
                  they don't extend to become information browsers? Nambu had integration with identi.ca
                  at one point. Then it dropped it. In the Blogging space everyone made blog readers
                  to read all blogs, now client vendors are locking themselves into one company's web
                  site. Weird...<br />
                  Could you provide a WebID enabled blog, so I don't have to create myself a username/password
                  just to comment? <br />http://esw.w3.org/foaf+ssl</div>

               <div class="commentBody">I don't understand your argument. You seem to be saying that browser vendors are doing
                  something evil by deciding what to pay attention to, because they leave out other
                  technologies you may want to use.¶You... do realize that there are a finite number
                  of people working on browsers, with
                  a finite amount of attention, right? There is more possible stuff to implement than
                  they can ever actually do, so they *must* discriminate.¶Does *somebody* want to do
                  client-side software in XSLT2.0? Sure, it's likely there's
                  at least one person who wants that. Is the reward from implementing the necessary
                  support worth the effort of that implementation? So far, the answer is no. That's
                  fine. There are simply more valuable things to spend time on.¶You seem to be arguing
                  that this prioritization of time is, itself, an evil thing.
                  You even call browser vendors a "junta" for doing this. This seems incoherent (not
                  to mention hyperbolic). What are they supposed to do? Work on everything at once?
                  That's impossible. Make it possible for you to add anything you want? That can't get
                  any easier than it already is, where you can write a plugin or hack the open-source
                  code directly. Work on the specific things you want? Prove that enough other people
                  care about it, and browsers will do so.¶Is there something I'm missing here? Right
                  now you seem to just be shouting that you
                  want browsers to implement everything at once.¶(Also, I second the call for some other
                  commenting authentication. Forcing readers
                  to actually register just to post a comment is obnoxious. I *almost* just quit, after
                  having written my whole comment, just because I found it annoying.)</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Read it more carefully. I didn't say the browser vendors were evil or that they were
                  adding the wrong features. I just bemoaned the fact that they have total control over
                  our destiny. We need more openness and extensibility than they are giving us. Sure,
                  we can write Javascript; but many of the things we would like to do for our users
                  are too expensive to do in that way. And we can write our own browsers (or alternative
                  clients), or we can write browser-specific plug-ins; but in most cases that doesn't
                  deliver what our users need either. For most practical purposes, if we want to deliver
                  significant new client-side functionality, we are at the mercy of the browser vendors.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Dude, you call them a junta.<br />
                  Anyway, yes, I still think your position is incoherent. Yes, browser vendors are in
                  charge of what you use, by virtue of the fact that you use browsers, and they write
                  them. "Openness" and "extensibility" are not magical. You would not be satisfied simply
                  by having an XML parser around. You need actual *support*, which takes time and effort.<br />
                  Time and effort are finite. We have more specs than we have time. Thus, some specs
                  won't be implemented. You're basically asking for browser vendors to implement everything
                  at once, and then declaring them a junta when they say "Um, we don't have the resources
                  to do that."<br />
                  If you just objected to the *particular* choices browser vendors made, that would
                  be fine. It's cool if you think they prioritized incorrectly. Your argument, though,
                  is that they shouldn't prioritize at all, and by prioritizing they are doing something
                  evil.<br />
                  You have exactly as much openness and extensibility as can be offered. If you want
                  support for a new technology in the browser, you have to *implement it in the browser*.
                  Luckily you can do that, since half the browsers are open-source. This is difficult,
                  sure, but by its very nature you can't make it any easier.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">So, are you unhappy with the particular decisions being made, or with the fact that
                  decisions were made at all? Your original post suggests the latter, which I find incoherent.<br />
                  You say "What if someone wants to develop a client-side app with XSLT2?". What if
                  they do? This question isn't rhetorical. If enough people want to do this, then browser
                  vendors will find it worthwhile to implement support for it.<br />
                  This is where I expect you'll object, given that this is the point of your original
                  post. "Why do the browser vendors get to decide whether it's valuable enough to support?"
                  The simple answer is that *someone* has to decide this. *You can't support everything.*
                  There's no magic wand you can wave, no trivial little switch to implement in your
                  code that will make XSLT2 be implemented, or RDFa, or MusicXML, or insert-your-favorite-spec-here.<br />
                  Someone has to spend a non-trivial amount of effort to make these technologies be
                  supported in browsers. Who do you think does that effort? Browser vendors. You can
                  do it too, if you want, if you have the necessary expertise. Unfortunately, there's
                  no way to make this easier. There's no way to expose the necessary tools to authors
                  to let them implement these things themselves without making it as difficult as just
                  downloading the browser source and hacking on it directly.<br />
                  So, what's your alternative? You're angry about something, but unless I'm mistaken,
                  it's about the fact that programming is hard and takes time. Sorry, that can't be
                  fixed, and it's not the W3C's fault.<br />
                  (The only other thing I can see your argument meaning is that you're angry that browsers
                  are insufficiently democratic. Presumably by "democratic" you mean something other
                  than "whatever the most users want", since that's what they already do in order to
                  compete with other browsers. I'm not sure what you could be meaning then, though.)</div>

                  I don't believe that it can't be made easier. I don't believe it is impossible to

                  platform to the world. With a will, it could be done.<br />
                  I think this is the essence of the problem. If it's not possible for third parties
                  to add functionality to a browser without (a) getting the browser vendor to do the
                  work, (b) hacking the browser source, or (c) writing the app in Javascript, then the
                  architecture of the platform is badly broken - in fact, it can hardly be described
                  as a platform at all. Yet that is the situation we are in.</div>

                  Shrug. I disagree. The web and the browser are both immensely complex, and very security-sensitive.
                  If the browser exposed an interface that allowed a page author to, say, define something
                  equivalent to FileSaver, that would be *scary as hell*. Arbitrary, potentially evil
                  websites could abuse that to save files to my system without my permission.<br />
                  This is, of course, precisely what every program you've ever installed on your computer
                  can do as well. Normal people don't really understand security around installing normal
                  programs; they have even less awareness of the security implications of web pages,
                  and would be totally screwed if webpages started being literally as powerful as installed
                  programs (rather than just having all the same useful powers). Hell, *I'd* be screwed
                  in that case.</div>

                  Allowing to limit this API with the browser preferences is obviously required for

                  Such a question can only come from a person that hasn't done his homework.<br />
                  The fact is that there is a significant number of people asking questions on forums
                  such as stackoverflow.com why no browsers support the use of XSLT 2.0 processors.
                  It shouldn't be difficult to provide XSLT 2.0 support in a browser that already provides
                  XSLT 1.0 support -- what is needed is just a switch to the newer (version) XSLT processor.</div>

                  be a maximum quota for implementers in W3C Working Groups?¶I'm convinced that Web
                  technologies are going to be the everyday technologies for
                  any kind of softwares. Universities and software companies should contribute more
                  actively. Why not having free members?</div>

               <div class="commentBody">That the browser vendors are determined to be the sole authority on implementation
                  has been a discussion in the past, but there's been little or no move within the W3C
                  to check this.<br />
                  Consider the current WhatWG and W3C HTML WG parallel effort that causes confusion
                  and more that a few problems. This could end, easily, if three of the browser vendors
                  stated the WhatWG will be no more. That they don't is tantamount to a threat to the
                  W3C: do what we say or we'll pick up our marbles and go elsewhere.<br />
                  Recently the HTML5 accessibility subgroup came forth with a list of video requirements,
                  and the actual recording of these requirements was challenged. That's unheard of in
                  the computing world. The users provide requirements, and afterward, work with the
                  developers to determine what can, and cannot be done.<br />
                  If this were a business environment what is happening is the equivalent of the development
                  staff going into a meeting with the users and the developers telling the users, keep
                  your user requirements, we'll tell you what you'll get.<br />
                  However, the W3C enables this. Look at the leadership for the HTML5 working group:
                  two browser representatives, and someone from IBM. The W3C has signaled exactly who
                  matters, and it isn't thee, or me.<br />
                  Why would the organization do differently just because you're all face to face?</div>

                  The browser vendors *are* the implementors. I have no idea who else you could possibly
                  think should be the authority on implementation than the implementors themselves.
                  Are you suggesting that browser vendors should be forced to implement things based
                  on someone else's judgement?<br />
                  "Recently the HTML5 accessibility subgroup came forth with a list of video requirements,

                  a11y subgroup does indeed contain many disabled people, of course.)<br />
                  The hope is that the accessibility subgroup *represents* disabled users, and produces
                  a list detailing their requirements. The list they actually produced shows that they
                  didn't succeed 100% at that goal - most of the goals are perfectly fine, but some
                  are clearly not accessibility requirements.<br />

               <div class="commentBody">Oh good lord, no.<br />
                  I've worked for a quarter of a century in a variety of industries--from creating a
                  touch screen application for a door factory in Wisconsin to working on Saudi Arabia's
                  air defense system. You never pre-determine user needs. You never do this, because
                  you don't know the business, you don't necessarily know what the people want or need.<br />
                  Users put together requirements, and _from this_, you work with the users to determine
                  what is feasible, and what isn't. There are restrictions, such as available technology,
                  budget, government restrictions, and so on, but within these constraints, the users
                  should have a significant say in the finished product.<br />
                  Web specifications are no different. How the standards are implemented, the exact
                  algorithms to meet the end goal, should be up to the implementors, but the standards
                  themselves should be driven by the users--of which the browser companies are just
                  one of the many. The browser companies should say what is or is not doable, or is
                  insecure, or inefficient. In addition, those creating other tools and libraries should
                  also provide feedback about what works. This in addition to accessibility groups,
                  designers, and web developers--all users, all with a stake in the final product.<br />
                  Anything else is the height of arrogance. Not only that, it's foolish in the extreme.
                  If you put something into a standard that only browser companies want, other users
                  aren't going to be interested. So then the browser companies have spent time implementing
                  something no one needs, or wants.<br /></div>

                  That's a very limited view of the users. I worked in one place where the company decided
                  to locate the computing department people among the end users. You quickly learn that
                  a) end users really don't like tech professionals condescending to them, and b) tech
                  professionals don't have all the answers.<br />
                  You figure out what the users need by working _with_ them, not taking what they give
                  you, or you think they've given you, and then using your own viewpoint to determine
                  that they can or cannot have.<br /><br /></div>

                  Mike Kay has been in these processes for years, in situations where they actually
                  worked. Implementers were part of the conversation, not the dominant force. There
                  was no WHATWG to jump up and down and insist that only its opinions really mattered.
                  Those processes weren't perfect - I'm far from a W3C fan - and I know they included
                  developer tantrums, balanced by other tantrums and some occasionally calm conversation.<br />
                  Pretty much every document-writing process is create, feedback, amend. The ugly questions
                  here are the ones Kay raised - WHO creates, WHO gets listened to, and WHO amends.<br />
                  It's one thing not to implement specs - I think we're all aware how that works. It's
                  another thing entirely to use that power of implementation to tell a specification
                  group what it should specify. It's not at all to the W3C's credit that it's let what's
                  left of its process get shat on this way.</div>

                  WHO creates the spec should not be identical to WHO creates the software. Period.
                  That's at the heart of Kay's original complaint.<br />
                  A conversation with "browser users" is a difficult thing to imagine. So far as I can
                  tell, WHATWG simply cherrypicks the users it cares to be interested in.<br />
                  And WHO amends is all too tightly in the hands of the writer who pretends his title
                  is editor. Perhaps the most appalling part of this entire process is that the W3C

                  one. I'm angry that we as a community created such a closed platform in which we can
                  only move forward as fast as the slowest browser vendor.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">One of the main issues is that the WHATWG people are focused on applications rather
                  than content. Their view on content is either simplistic (like this blog postings'
                  markup) or object model / UI centric. Despite the cool bells &amp; whistles, parts of
                  HTML5 are certainly reactionary, disregarding the markup and markup processing standardization
                  efforts of the past 13 years.<br />
                  Maybe they don't think they're as reactionary as they are. They probably regard themselves
                  as revolutionary because they don't need rely on RDBMSs but on JSON or other object
                  storage facilities. They don't see the benefit that XML and related standards have
                  brought to content processing. They just see that for their purposes, XML-related
                  standards are difficult to implement, and they (the WHATWG/HTML5 people) do not benefit
                  from implementing XML-related standards because they manipulate, for example, SVG
                  with a DOM or some other Javascript interface and not XSLT/XQuery. Their XML is JSON,
                  their XSLT/XQuery is Javascript.<br />
                  Yesterday I was shocked to see a similar backlash movement in my own company.<br />
                  I think there's no other way than to get involved with the Mozilla project, convince
                  them that it won't hurt them feature- or supportwise to include an advanced XSLT/XQuery
                  processor, and create cool applications that run with client-side XSLT/XQuery/XPath
                  3.0, such as interactive books or balance sheets delivered as purely declarative markup
                  together with sleek &amp; concise stylesheets.<br />
                  What may be missing from XSLT's side in this application scenario: an event model,
                  i.e., a standard way to bind user interactions to certain transformations on certain
                  content, and a way to make sense of user-submitted values in XSLT templates. From
                  what I saw at XML Prague 2010, some XQuery vendors are more advanced than XSLT in
                  the field of interactive applications. But I think XQuery's capabilities are somewhat
                  limited when it comes to perform complex content transformations, and so are Javascript's.
                  I'd like to see the elegance and expressive power of XSLT/XPath 2.0/3.0 applied to
                  content-based Web applications.</div>

                  Yes - there's enormous potential here to apply XSLT's event-based processing model
                  to create an interactive user interface. I must take a closer look at what XSLTForms
                  has already achieved.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">About XSLTForms and browsers, there are two distinct parts to be considered: the XSLT
                  initial step and the Javascript XForms engine.<br />
                  Browsers support XSLT 1.0 (except Konqueror) but vendors don't seem to be concerned
                  by reported bugs. The most important problem is in Mozilla FireFox: the namespace
                  axis is not supported... There is at least one issue with the Opera XSLT engine about
                  passing parameters to a template... IE9 will use MSXML6 while previous versions still
                  use MSXML3 (XPath not being the default query language!).<br />
                  Hopefully the XSLT engines are always very fast comparing to Javascript interpreted
                  instructions. For XSLTForms, they really act as compilers and it's one of the reasons
                  of XSLTForms success comparing to pure Javascript solutions approach. XForms controls
                  and events are translated into HTML controls and events+Javascript objects, that's
                  all! XPath expressions are translated in Javascript objects, they are not parsed and
                  evaluated everytime, they are compiled.<br />
                  But it is really a shame not to have XSLT 2.0 engines because parsing strings with
                  XSLT 1.0 is awful, because the lack of sequences forced me to construct results with
                  structured strings to be analyzed, after, with substring-before() and substring-after()
                  functions,...<br />
                  The Javascript engine of XSLTForms doesn't depend on any Javascript framework. It's
                  good because extensions can be done with any of them but it means that specific instructions
                  for each browser have to be present. As usual, Internet Explorer is the most concerned
                  by this problem but it is not the only one.<br />
                  XSLTForms first releases used a specific Javascript DOM implementation because of
                  differences in browsers but it was too slow. Now, XSLTForms uses native XML documents.
                  Still, there are major differences on the DOM API to be addressed by different Javascript
                  instructions.<br />
                  XSLTForms still has its own XPath engine because there are XForms specific XPath functions
                  but also because node dependencies have to be collected to reduce refreshing operations
                  when necessary. This will allow to develop a specific XPath 2.0 engine and I am still
                  thinking of implementing a basic XQuery engine with the same approach.<br />
                  I have also translated one of the XSLT 2.0 stylesheets of graph2svg project into an
                  XSLT 1.0 stylesheet to be launched by the browser for displaying SVG graph from data.
                  Again, the lack of sequences but also of math functions required a lot of complexity.<br />
                  Don't hesitate to contact me for more details about XSLTForms.<br />
                  For me, XML technologies are like LEGO bricks and I'm very glad that the W3C understood
                  that, a long time ago. Obviously, at least some browser vendors haven't that in mind
                  yet.<br />
                  Thanks!<br />

               <div class="commentBody">I guess I'm having trouble getting worked up about this.<br />
                  Considering how badly the Enterprise world has fucked up, the Mobile world has fucked
                  up, and how every app store is turning into a private money machine, the fact that
                  the browsers are working together to innovate and provide multiple implementations
                  of a standard -- which granted they are driving -- doesn't seem so bad.<br />
                  Yes, this empowers them. If their failing is that they haven't figured out how to
                  deliver the all-singing-all-dancing extensible application delivery platform that's
                  interoperable across multiple uncoordinated implementations, I'll forgive them for
                  that. But they better get their act together soon, dammit!</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Michael,<br />
                  Good input about the Technical Plenary.<br />
                  As Chair of the Technical Plenary, I confess that I thought it would <br />be a good idea to have a focus on HTML5, and that was part of the <br />agenda.<br />
                  I also worked with the program committee to create a balanced agenda. We had talks
                  about the Semantic Web, IETF, XML convergence with HTML, and accessibility. We had
                  a session on different use cases and perspectives for television broadcast. There
                  was also quite a diversity in Lightning Talks: Emotions, the Social Web, Speech, Semantic
                  Web, Relational and RDF, 3D, Points of Interest, XML Performance, Privacy, and Philosophy.<br />
                  But I take your point. There is even more diversity in W3C activities <br />and a big part of W3C's value is our effort to bridge multiple <br />communities. I note that we have set up a survey for TPAC participants to share their
                  thoughts on the meeting and I will include your suggestion in the set of recommendations
                  we will seek to address.<br />
                  I also share some of your disappointment. In a 20 August message, I reached out to
                  all W3C Members and Chairs for their best ideas. Nearly all requests - primarily in
                  the form of Lightning talks - were all included. Let's use this thread as a prompt
                  to work together so that the next TPAC agenda is more representative of all the work
                  going on at the Consortium.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">A vigorous exchange of arguments followed, but I am afraid the whole battle was fought
                  on the wrong ground, one floor above the floor where the heart of the matter is found.
                  The main question is perhaps not who should specify, who should select and who should
                  implement what. It is about content.<br />
                  Your personal work is all about building, creating new perspectives and possibilities
                  for other people to build and create. It is about enabling - not about impressing
                  and entertaining. Quality, precision, responsibility - they are what you are committed
                  to. You stand for a culture, and a spirit. What you saw and what upset you was the
                  lack of culture and the lack of spirit. A taste for the puerile and playful in command
                  of technological development. What you are upset about - is it not the apparent unconcern
                  for the role a browser may play in building structures, and helping us to solve difficult
                  and important problems? The irresponsible obsession with entertaining and impressing,
                  rather than building and solving problems. The hollowness.</div>
