      <h1>Unicode, regular expressions, and Java</h1>
      <p>
         
         Many moons ago, when I first introduced regular expression support to Saxon's XSLT
         processor, I picked up a piece of software written by James Clark to translate regular
         expressions as defined in the XML Schema specification to regular expressions as understood
         by Java. Like any software written by James, it was extremely robust, handled all
         the quirks of the underlying specifications with unfailing accuracy, was tightly coded
         and fast, and was totally undocumented. </p>
      <p>One of the particular tasks it handled was to handle the fact that the Schema/XPath
         regex dialect counted characters above 65535 as one character, whereas the Java regex
         library until JDK 1.4 treated them as two. </p>
      <p>Over the years I've modified the code a bit. When JDK 1.5 came along and handled high-end
         characters correctly, I forked the code and produced one version for JDK 1.4, another
         for JDK 1.5. A third version targetted the .NET regex dialect. In Saxon 9.2 I finally
         got rid of the JDK 1.4 version, and I was also able to get rid of the .NET version
         by switching from using the .NET regular expression library to the library in OpenJDK,
         which had finally become reliable enough. </p>
      <p>Another of the tasks performed by James's code was to map character classes such as
         \P{Lu} (matching any upper-case character) from what XPath said it should mean to
         what Java thought it meant. This code has been untouched until now, but I've decided
         to take a fresh look at it and see whether it is really needed. Apart from the problem
         of high-end characters, it seems that what it was really doing was coping with differences
         between Unicode versions. It's a little hard to unearth the history now of which specifications
         mandated which Unicode version, but the current situation seems to be that JDK 1.5
         and 1.6 support Unicode 4.0, while the schema (and hence XPath) specs originally specified
         Unicode 3.1, but now allow you to support whatever later Unicode version you like.
         So 4.0 support would be fine. </p>
      <p>I've generated XML documents showing the mapping of characters to classes by three
         different methods: direct Java coding using the JDK regex engine; XSLT code using
         Saxon 9.2 which uses the Clark translation of regular expressions to the JDK engine;
         and analysis of the data files published by the Unicode consortium. </p>
      <p>Between Saxon and the JDK there is a very close match. The only difference is that
         the JDK category C includes subcategory Cn (unassigned characters) whereas Saxon includes
         this subcategory in its parent class. </p>
      <p>Between the data coming from Unicode and the JDK there is a less close match,. This
         was because I worked with Unicode 5.2 data files, which includes many more characters
         than the JDK understands. But I've repeated the comparison with Unicode 4.0.0 files,
         and this gives a very close match, after allowing for expected discrepancies such
         as the omission of surrogates (which are non-characters in XPath) in one of the lists. </p>
      <p>So, it's looking as if I can cut out a lot more of James' translation code. </p>
      <p>There does seem to be one snag that I need to look at further: in one of my attempts
         to collect this data, I used the complement classes such as \P{Cn}, replacing characters
         that matched this term with an empty string. The result was a string containing unmatched
         surrogates, which immediately crashes Saxon. This could be a bug in the JDK handling
         of surrogate pairs, or it could be something else that I don't yet understand. One
         of the difficulties with regex handling has always been that you're very exposed to
         bugs in the regex library for the final ounce of conformance, and if you hit them,
         there's sometimes not much you can do about them.

               <div class="commentBody">Not directly - I suspect it has diverged too far to make that easy. The work I've
                  done to adapt it to JDK 1.5 would be useful to other projects, but the extensions
                  to handle XPath regex extensions, etc, wouldn't; and they are all mixed up together.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Update: I have confirmed that there's a bug in the JDK regex handling, and have reported
                  it to Sun (their ID 1695003). The problem is that if a string S contains non-BMP characters
                  matching \p{Lu}, then a search for the complement \P{Lu} returns hits on the low surrogates
                  of those characters in the UTF-16 representation of S. James's expansion of \P{Lu}
                  (which includes a long list of non-BMP characters matching \p{Lu}) manages to bypass
                  the bug - and so far I haven't found any other way of bypassing it. (Ignore my tweet
                  on the subject, it was wrong)</div>
