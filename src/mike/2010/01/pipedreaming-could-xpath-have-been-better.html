      <h1>Pipedreaming: Could XPath have been better?</h1>
      <p>I normally resist the kind of wishful thinking that tries to improve languages like
         XML or XPath without worrying about backwards compatibility. In practice you can never
         ignore the legacy: compatibility means deliberately repeating other people's mistakes,
         as David Wheeler used to say when I was an undergraduate. But it's New Year, so let's
         be absurdly optimistic, and assume that anything can be done. (And what set me on
         to this was actually something quite practical: Anthony Coates is looking at the XML
         support in Scala. Scala has a kind of XPath-like expression that adapts the XPath
         syntax into the Scala framework. So in such an environment, there is indeed an opportunity
         to rethink things.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the changes I think I would make:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Avoid the overloading of [] to act as both a filter and a subscript operator. Perhaps
            use [] for subscripting and ? for filtering, or perhaps use ! for subscripting and
            [] for filtering. The current overloading, especially because it is decided dynamically
            rather than statically, causes some very odd effects in edge cases. For the present,
            I'll avoid [] entirely, and use ? for the filter operator, and ! for subscript. We'll
            postpone decisions on operator precedence until later.
            </li>
         <li>Remove the special rules for subscripting when following a reverse axis. If X delivers
            items A, B, C, then X!1 delivers A, regardless of the nature of the expression X.
            </li>
         <li>The subscript operator would then be a simple binary operator: both operands would
            be evaluated in the same context. No special magic about N being a shorthand for position()=N.
            This removes the ability to use last() as a pseudo-subscript. Most languages seem
            to get by without such a feature, but I have to admit it is useful; I'd suggest either
            (a) a convention that negative subscripts number from the end (so X!-1 selects the
            last item), or (b) a separate operator, say , to number backwards (it's high time
            we broke free from the shackles of ASCII...). Then X1 selects the last item in the
            sequence.
            </li>
         <li>Replace / with \ as the path operator, to avoid confusion with numeric division;
            and make it a pure mapping operator, with no implicit sorting into document order
            or deduplication. Remove all remaining restrictions on what can appear on the lh and
            rh sides. Use an explicit unary | operator for this purpose when required (so |EXP
            has the same meaning as ()|EXP, that is, take the nodes in EXP, deduplicate, and sort
            into document order).
            </li>
         <li>Lose the leading "/" in path expressions, as well as the lone "/" to refer to the
            root node. Instead use root() at the start of the path to get the root node of the
            tree containing the context node.
            </li>
         <li>Drop the abbreviation allowing E as a short-hand for child::E. Controversial, this
            one - the short-hand is very convenient. But it causes a lot of problems in making
            the grammar unambiguous and extensible. Replace it with a new abbreviation, on the
            same lines as "@" for the attribute axis: let's say ^. So a path expression might
            look like root()\^A\^B\@C. Not as pretty as what we are used to, but much more systematic,
            orthogonal, and extensible.
            </li>
         <li>This then suggests ^^ as an abbreviation for the descendant axis, replacing the
            current highly-illogical // pseudo-operator with its wierd syntactic expansion.
            </li>
         <li>Drop the implicit existential semantics for the "=" family of operators, giving
            them instead the same meaning that "eq" and friends have in XPath 2.0. Again, this
            removes a convenience in the interests of being more rigorous and orthogonal. It would
            be nice to offer something that's as general as the expression "some $x in X satisfies
            $x = 3" but less verbose; I would suggest prefixing any boolean operator or function
            name with "~" to indicate that it is to operate over sequences and behave existentially,
            so we have X ~= 3 to mean "some X equals 3", and ~contains(X, ('a', 'b')) to mean
            "some X contains 'a' or 'b'". 
            </li>
         <li>Unify axes and functions. Conceptually, child::X applies the function child() to
            the context node and then filters the result with the predicate "is an X". There is
            no reason why "child" (the axis) should not be any function, rather than forcing it
            to be one of 13 magic functions built in to the system. There is also no reason why
            X (the nodetest) should not be generalised. Assuming a syntax .T to test whether the
            context node satisfies the nodetest T,  X::T becomes a shorthand for X(.)?(.T), and
            this semantic definition paves the way to allowing X to be any single-argument function,
            and for generalizing nodetests to be any pattern. The overall effect is to make the
            semantics of XPath as a functional language much more explicit.
            </li>
         <li>Unify node tests and types. Both are essentially ways of classifying nodes (or other
            items). XPath 2.0 already goes some way towards making them interchangeable through
            the concept of "kind tests", but it could go further.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What is all this trying to achieve? The bottom line, I guess, is</p>
      <p>(a) making the semantics of the language cleaner and more explicitly functional; </p>
      <p>(b) removing quirkiness and non-orthogonality even where these quirks provide ways
         ways of expressing commonly used constructs more concisely</p>
      <p>Of course, it's all an academic exercise. But perhaps it points the way to a better
         way of describing the current language by mapping the syntax onto a more regular core.<br />

               <div class="commentBody">Interesting observations, some clearly not realistic, but some possibly workable.
                  Most interesting to me from the latter category is the idea of unifying axes, node
                  tests and functions - that could very well work, and provides some welcome possibilities
                  for extending path syntax for other types of data.</div>

               <div class="commentBody">Using consistent notation, "all in X satisfy P()" is written as: <br /> X, P()<br />
                  and "None in X satisfy P()" is written:<br />

               <div class="commentBody">Hello Michael, sorry to visit late,<br />
                  Some of your syntactic propositions make me choke, <br />but generally speaking I can only agree with bottom-line points a and b.<br />
                  I like pipedreaming too: <br />my favorite dream around XQuery and XSLT2 is to imagine an hypothetic language unifying
                  the two. I might look an heretic, but I have always felt it is a real shame to have
                  two different languages sharing 90% of their capabilities. XSLT2 would have represented
                  the XML syntax of this hypothetic language and XQuery the "compact syntax", so to
                  say. At least, we would have avoided the infamous ugly XQueryX.<br />
                  Sorry if I sound offensive, just rambling... <br /></div>

               <div class="commentBody">It would be nice to see support for Unicode mathematical characters, for example 
                  instead of &amp;lt;=<br />
                  The necessity to write &amp;lt; in XSLT reduces readability a lot -- perhaps there is
                  some way to bypass?? <br /></div>
