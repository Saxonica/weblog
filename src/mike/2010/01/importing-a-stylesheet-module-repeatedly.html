      <h1>Importing a stylesheet module repeatedly</h1>
      <p>
         
         I'm looking at a case submitted by a user where XSLT compilation is very slow. It
         turns out to be caused by the same module being repeatedly imported with many different
         import precedences (in the case of one module, with 174 different import precedences).
         The user has a solution (only import it once, or change some of the imports to includes);
         but I'm wondering what changes to make to prevent the problem recurring.</p>
      <p>In this particular case, the stylesheet uses many functions and not many template
         rules. This is significant because the two cases are different: with functions, a
         named function that is masked by another with the same name and arity but higher precedence
         is dead wood: it can never be invoked, so all the costs of compiling it and optimising
         it are unnecessary. With template rules however, a template can always be reached
         using xsl:apply-imports or xsl:next-match, so it can never be discarded.</p>
      <p>The specification says that including or importing the same module twice has exactly
         the same effect as if you included or imported two different modules that happened
         to have the same content. And that's exactly how Saxon behaves: it doesn't remember
         which modules have previously been read, so the second import/include causes the same
         document to be read from disk, parsed into a tree, and then to go through all the
         stages of XSLT and XPath static analysis. Clearly this involves a lot of wasted work.</p>
      <p>The first question is, how much does this matter? How many users does it affect, and
         how badly does it affect them? It's impossible to answer the question statistically,
         so the usual test I apply is that if the code is correct and a reasonable user might
         write it in this way, then the software has a responsibility to try and execute it
         with reasonable efficiency. The principle (another one I remember from David Wheeler
         - he was an appalling lecturer, but he seems to have drilled some firm ideas into
         my brain) is "optimize the code that reasonable users actually write". And it does
         seem that a reasonable user, seeing that module A has a dependency on module B, might
         well add a redundant import declaration, and would not expect this to have an adverse
         effect on performance.</p>
      <p>The next question is how far we should go in eliminating the unnecessary processing
         that is currently being done. Let's look at where the inefficiencies arise:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>We are parsing the same module repeatedly (about 10% of the cost), then parsing
            its XPath expressions repeatedly (another 10%), and doing other miscellaneous static
            checking (say another 5%).</li>
         <li>In the case of functions, we do a serial search to bind function calls to stylesheet
            functions, which is taking a long time because there are multiple instances of the
            same function. I have already implemented a hash lookup to fix this particular problem,
            which has halved the compilation time.</li>
         <li>Again in the case of functions, we are type-checking and optimizing functions that
            can never be called because they are masked by another of higher import precedence.
            This is another 10% or so of the overhead, and I have already made changes to eliminate
            it.</li>
         <li>In the case of template rules, the "masked" templates do need to be type-checked
            and optimized because they can be called, using apply-imports or next-match. However,
            we could potentially take advantage of the fact that two template rules with different
            import precedence can share the same executable code: if they come from different
            incarnations of the same module, then they will have identical static contexts, and
            could therefore be compiled once and share the same compiled code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can do some of these optimizations (like doing less work to process masked functions)
         without any change to the strategy of reading and parsing modules repeatedly. But
         other optimizations do mean that we need to recognize when two modules derive from
         the same source. In particular, we need to distinguish a "masked" function that comes
         from the same source module from a "masked" function deriving from a different source
         module: in the latter case, the spec requires all static errors to be detected even
         though the code is dead, while in the former case we know that we only need to do
         the analysis once to report all static errors.</p>
      <p>The toughest aspect of this is that there is an impact on data structures. This is
         particularly the case with template rules: the idea of two template rules sharing
         the same executable code even though they have different import precedence, and then
         taking advantage of this to only type-check and optimize the code once. Changing data
         structures is always the hardest kind of change. But it's probably worth doing.<br />
