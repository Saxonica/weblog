      <h1>Parameterized validation</h1>
      <p>
         
         I've been implementing an enhancement to the Saxon schema processor that has been
         on my wish-list for a long time: it allows schema validation to be parameterized using
         parameter values supplied on the command line or via the validation API. The parameter
         values can be referenced from any XPath expression in the schema, for example in assertions
         or in conditional type assignment. </p>
      <p>For example, suppose you are validating invoices. Your schema might allow a wide range
         of currencies to be used, but for a particular batch of invoices, you want the currency
         to be USD, and in another batch, you want it to be EUR. Then you can write the schema
         with a parameter: <code>&lt;saxon:param name="currency" as="xs:string" select="'USD'"/&gt;</code>; in the definition of the simple type invoice:currency you can write the assertion <code>&lt;xs:assert test="$value = $currency"/&gt;</code>, and when invoking the validation from the command line you can set the parameter
         currency=EUR. The select attribute of <code>&lt;saxon:param&gt;</code>, as with stylesheet parameters in XSLT, defines a default value. Very simple. </p>
      <p>There are of course many tricky details to be worked out. What should the scope of
         a parameter name be? (currently, it's confined to the schema document in which it
         is declared). But then, what if you want to reference the same parameter in more than
         one schema document? (current thinking, you can declare it in both and the declarations
         must be compatible). Should parameters automatically be in the target namespace of
         their containing schema document, like other declarations in a schema? (current thinking:
         no, follow the XSLT rules instead: no prefix means no namespace). </p>
      <p>For free-standing validation from the command line or from the s9api API, it's fairly
         easy to devise an interface for supplying parameters. It's less easy when validation
         is invoked from XSLT or XQuery. For XSLT, a new &lt;saxon:validate&gt; instruction with
         &lt;xsl:with-param&gt; children seems appropriate. For XQuery, it probably needs a custom
         extension to the syntax of the validate{} expression. </p>
      <p>There are many use cases for such a feature. I've often seen cases, for example, where
         one wants to apply increasingly rigorous validation to a document at different stages
         in its life-cycle. Another example is parameterized code-lists. With some creativity,
         it can also be used to achieve cross-document validation: the parameters supplied
         when validating one instance document can be taken from another instance document
         (or indeed, an entire instance document can be supplied as a parameter value). Given
         higher-order functions in XPath 2.1, the validation parameter can even be a dynamic
         function that is invoked from within the assertions. </p>
      <p>Currently, parameterizing a schema is often achieved using xs:redefine, and in XSD
         1.1, the xs:override feature is designed to make this approach more flexible. However,
         there's a big limitation with this, namely that overriding or redefining a type acts
         globally: it affects every place the type is used. This means, for example, that you
         can't use two different variants of a schema to validate the input and the output
         of a transformation (for example, a transformation whose purpose is to convert documents
         from one flavour of vocabulary X to a different flavour of the same vocabulary). </p>
      <p>The mechanism allows parameters to be used anywhere schemas use XPath expressions:
         primarily in assertions and in conditional type assignment; but also in identity constraints
         (for which I have yet to find any practical utility) and in the saxon:preprocess extension
         which allows you to vary the allowed lexical representations of a data type. (See <a href="/mike/2008/10/xml-schema-allowing-new-lexical-forms.html">saxon:preprocess blog article</a>). For example, you can already write <code>&lt;saxon:preprocess action="if ($value='yes') then 'true' else if ($value='no') then
            'false' else $value"/&gt;</code> to create a subtype of xs:boolean that permits the lexical forms "yes" and "no";
         with this new feature you can parameterize this to make the strings "yes" and "no"
         parameters supplied at validation time rather than constants. </p>
      <p>There's a drawback, of course, which is that this is a proprietary extension. However
         much one takes advantage of the extensibility points provided in the specifications
         (such as xs:appinfo in the XSD spec, or extension elements in XSLT), there's no hiding
         the fact that an application that takes advantage of a feature like this is locking
         itself in to Saxon as the validation technology. However, there's no harm in this:
         many features that found their way into the standards, and into other products, were
         first pioneered in Saxon; it's often better if products are one step ahead of the
         standards rather than one step behind. </p>
      <p>I think there would probably be some resistance to this feature in the XML Schema
         Working Group (and not just because of timescales): there are some strongly held philosophical
         views among WG members, and one of them is that validity is a context-free property.
         There are reasons for this: if you validate data before sending it to me, you don't
         want me to find that in my environment, it's not valid. Personally, I'm a pragmatist
         on this kind of issue. If you have to change the definition of the data interchange
         from "must conform to schema S" to "must conform to schema S with parameter settings
         P=X, Q=Y", that's not something that worries me. On the contrary, I think it creates
         a real opportunity for increased use of industry-standard schemas parameterized by
         local profiles that define additional constraints to those in the standard specification.
