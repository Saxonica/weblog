      <h1>The ten most common XSLT programming mistakes</h1>
      <p>
         
         In response to a user recently, I told him he had fallen into the most common elephant
         trap for XSLT users. Rather than being annoyed, which I half expected, he thanked
         me and asked me if I could tell him what the next most common elephant traps were.
         Although some of us have been helping users avoid these traps for many years, I don't
         recall seeing a list of them, so I thought I would spend half an hour compiling my
         own list. </p>
      <p>1. Matching elements in the default namespace. If the source document contains a default
         namespace declaration xmlns="something", then every time you refer to an element name
         in an XPath expression or match pattern, you have to make it clear you are talking
         about names in that namespace. In XSLT 1.0 you have to bind a prefix to this namespace
         (for example xmlns:p="something" on the xsl:stylesheet element) and then use this
         prefix throughout, for example match="p:chapter/p:section". In XSLT 2.0 an alternative
         is to declare default-xpath-namespace="something" on the xsl:stylesheet element. </p>
      <p>2. Using relative paths. xsl:apply-templates and xsl:for-each set the context node;
         within the "loop", paths should be written to start from this context node. For example,
         &lt;xsl:for-each select="chapter"&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="title"/&gt;&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;. Common
         mistakes are to use an absolute path within the loop (for example select="//title"),
         or to repeat the name of the context node in the relative path (select="chapter/title"). </p>
      <p>3. Variables hold values, not fragments of expression syntax. Some people imagine
         that a variable reference $x is like a macro, expanded into the syntax of an XPath
         expression by textual substitution - rather like variables in shell script languages.
         It isn't: you can only use a variable where you could use a value. For example, if
         $N holds the string 'para', then the path expression chapter/$N does not mean the
         same as chapter/para. Instead, you need chapter/*[name()=$N]. If a variable holds
         something more complex than a simple name (for example, a full path expression) then
         you need an extension like saxon:evaluate() to evaluate it. </p>
      <p>4. Template rules and xsl:apply-templates are not an advanced feature to be used only
         by advanced users. They are the most basic fundamental construct in the XSLT language.
         Don't keep putting off the day when you start to use them. If you aren't using them,
         you are making your life unnecessarily difficult. </p>
      <p>5. XSLT takes a tree as input, and produces a tree as output. Failure to understand
         this accounts for many of the frustrations beginners have with XSLT. XSLT can't process
         things that aren't represented in the tree produced by the XML parser (CDATA sections,
         entity references, the XML declaration) and it can't generate these things in the
         output either. If you think you need to do this, ask why: there's probably something
         wrong with your requirements or your design. </p>
      <p>6. Namespaces are difficult. There are no easy answers to getting them right: this
         probably needs another article of its own. The key is to understand the data model
         for namespaces. Namespaces appear in two guises: (a) every element and attribute has
         a name comprising a prefix, local name, and URI; and (b) elements own namespace nodes
         representing all the prefix/uri bindings in scope for that element. When you've understood
         this, you can understand the specifications for different instructions and their effect
         on namespaces in the result tree. Most of the time, all you need to do is to ensure
         that the elements you create are in the right namespace, and everything else will
         take care of itself. </p>
      <p>7. Don't use disable-output-escaping. Some people use it as magic fairy dust; they
         don't know what it does, but they hope it might make things work better. This attribute
         is for experts only, and experts will only use it as an absolute last resort. 95%
         of the time, if you see disable-output-escaping in a stylesheet, it tells you that
         the author was a novice who didn't know what s/he was doing. </p>
      <p>8. The &lt;xsl:copy-of&gt; instruction creates an exact copy of a source tree, namespaces
         and all. (Well, there's one exception, in XSLT 2.0 you can say copy-namespaces="no").
         If you want to copy a tree with changes, then you can't use xsl:copy-of. Instead,
         use the identity-template coding pattern: a template rule that uses &lt;xsl:copy&gt; to
         make a shallow copy of an element and applies-templates to its children, supplemented
         by template rules that override this behaviour for particular elements. </p>
      <p>9. Don't use &lt;xsl:variable name="x"&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="y"/&gt;&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;. Instead
         use &lt;xsl:variable name="x" select="y"/&gt;. The latter is shorter to write, and much
         more efficient to execute, and in many cases it's correct where the former is incorrect. </p>
      <p>10. When you need to search for data, use keys. As with template rules, don't put
         off learning how to use keys or dismiss them as an advanced feature. They are an essential
         tool of the trade. Searching for data without using keys is like using a screwdriver
         to hammer nails.

                  I wish there were web sites for XSLT and XQuery like those for Perl (http://learn.perl.org/

               <div class="commentBody">If I had to add an eleventh one that would be improper use of abbreviated <br />syntax in XPath expressions. I have seen countless stylesheets using things like: <br />.//a[1]<br />
                  to return the first 'a' below the context node which does not work if your DTD allows
                  an 'a' to occur below another 'a'. E.g. <br />//a[1] applied to &lt;a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;a/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; returns the three 'a' nodes. <br />(Happens in practice when you have mixed contents stuff). <br />I have also seen people writing stuf like /descendant::*[ 1 and (self::a or self::b)]
                  to mean the first 'a' or 'b' in pre-order. (the path before being wrong in two places
                  [ 1 and ... ] is like [ true and ... ] and not [ position() = 1 and ... ] and then
                  even with position() = 1, it selects the first node in pre-order if its label is a
                  or b. correct XPath would be /descendant::*[ self::a or self::b][position() = 1]</div>

                  in XSLT? I have been seeing a lot of stylesheets matching default namespace... so
                  they are all wrong? So is it possible to change the default namespace of the stylesheet
