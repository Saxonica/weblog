        <p>This article presents the Zeno Chain, a new data structure used
        to underpin the implementation of XDM sequences in Saxon. It is also
        designed to be capable of supporting XDM arrays, and might also have
        potential for holding long character strings.</p>
        <p>The current implementation of the Zeno Chain is a mutable list,
        but the design lends itself easily to creating an immutable variant.
        It also makes it easy to construct an immutable list from a mutable
        one, making it efficient to construct a sequence with in-situ
        modification, and then "freeze" it once construction is complete.</p>
        <p>Saxon currently uses a variety of structures for holding sequences
        and arrays. This variety is a problem in itself. Choosing the right
        structure for a particular scenario involves somewhat hit-or-miss 
        decision making; it would be better to have a single "all-rounder"
        structure that performs well in a variety of situations.</p>
        <p>There are of course vast numbers of data structures for sequences
        available in the computer science literature. One promising one,
        for example, is the "finger tree" which supports a wide range of
        access patterns efficiently. But it also has drawbacks: any tree
        structure that requires a node for each item in a list is going
        to have a large memory overhead when storing a long sequence, and
        the use of a fine-grained structure like this tends to mean that
        there is little locality of reference for memory addressing, leading
        to poor CPU caching performance.</p>
        <p>The Zeno chain stores a sequence as a list of lists of items:
        that is, it is a tree with a constant depth of 2. In the Java
        implementation, both levels of list are instances of 
        <code>java.util.ArrayList</code>. The key to the performance of the
            structure is managing the number and size of the second-level
            lists, which I call <i>segments</i>.</p>
        <p>In a list that is constructed by appending individual items
            on the end (a common scenario), the length of a segment
            increases the closer it is to the start. For a list of 20,000
            items, there are ten segments whose sizes are (8192, 4096, 4096, 
            2048, 1024, 256, 128, 64, 64, 32). (Now you know why I called
            it a Zeno chain.) The exact numbers don't matter
            here: what is important is that the total number of segments
            increases only logarithmically with the length of the sequence,
            and that the segments on the right are short, which makes further
            append operations efficient.</p>
        <p>In a list constructed by prepending individual items, the
            distribution of lengths will be the other way round: shortest
            segments near the front. In the rare case where both append and
            prepend operations occur, both ends will have short segments,
            while longer segments will cluster around the middle.</p>
        <p>Here's a summary of the major operations performed on the sequence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Append an item:</b> if the list is empty, construct a single
            segment of length 1. Otherwise, if the last segment has length &lt; 32,
            append to it. If the last segment is already full, coalesce the last segment with the previous
            segment if the previous segment has sufficient room; if not, work
            up the list to the start to find adjacent segments that can be merged.
            A segment is considered to have sufficient room for such expansion if its resulting size
            would not exceed 2^(N+5) where N is the distance of the segment
            from the right-hand end of the sequence; it's this formula that ensures
            that longer segments accumulate at the start of the sequence. If all
            segments in the sequence are full — that is, if the
            segment sizes are decreasing powers of two — then add a new segment. 
            Append operations essentially take constant time; 97% of them only
            affect the final segment.</li>
            <li><b>Prepend an item:</b> simply append in reverse.</li>
            <li><b>Get the Nth item:</b> search the master list of segments examining
            the sizes of the segments until
            the right segment is found, then get the item by addressing into the
            Java <code>ArrayList</code>. This takes logarithmic time. The average
            access time will be slightly higher in a list built by prepending items,
            because the chance of finding the required item in the first couple of
            segments is much lower.</li>
            <li><b>Subsequence:</b> make a new Zeno chain containing whole or part copies
            of the segments from the original chain that are in the required range.</li>
            <li><b>Iteration:</b> Keep two index positions, the index position in the master
            list, and the index position in the current segment, and use these indexes
            to retrieve the next item by calling <code>ArrayList.get()</code> twice.</li>
            <li><b>Sequence concatenation: </b> This is quite a common operation in
            XSLT and XPath, as it's the basis of the "flattening" operations such as
            <code>xsl:for-each</code>, <code>xsl:apply-templates</code>, and
            FLWOR expressions. The most direct approach is simply to concatenate the two
            master lists, leaving the segments unchanged. This however can lead to 
            fragmentation of the sequence, so we perform a reorganization to
            reduce the number of short segments. Specifically, working from the
            right hand end, if any segment is found to be shorter than both its
            immediate neighbours, we combine it with the left-hand neighbour
            and reduce the number of segments by one. This has the effect of reducing
            the incidence of short segments in the middle of the chain.</li>
            <li><b>Insertion, removal, and replacement: </b> these operations
            are comparatively rare. With the immutable version of the structure,
            an alteration affecting one of the larger segments will require copying
            of everything else in that segment. This isn't ideal: but it's better
            than copying the entire sequence, which is what often happens today.
            And the use of the Java <code>ArrayList</code> at least means that the
            copying is very fast.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to note that most operations on sequences don't actually
            result in a new sequence being constructed. Calling <code>tail()</code>,
            for example, doesn't copy any data: it delivers an iterator over a portion
            of the original sequence. The sequence only gets materialized if, for example
            the result is stored in a variable (and even then, not always).</p>
        <p>Saxon's default implementation for a sequence is simply a Java List.
            Appending an item to a list generally copies the whole list. Where Saxon
            can detect that this is going to be inefficient, it instead uses a structure
            called a Chain: this is effectively a tree of segments. But there's little
            serious attempt to manage the depth of the tree or the size of the segments,
            and the results in some cases can be rather poor.The Zeno chain offers
            a signficant improvement; it also looks as if it can be used for arrays
            as well as sequences.</p>
        <p>For managing long strings, I invented a similar structure, which I then
            discovered already existed in the literature and is known as a Rope:
            a Rope represents a string as a tree of substrings. The literature on
            Ropes describes how to keep the tree balanced, but it has nothing to say
            about how to decide how many substrings to hold, and how long to make them.
            The Zeno chain might turn out to provide an answer to that question.
