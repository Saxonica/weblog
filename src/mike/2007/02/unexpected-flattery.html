      <h1>Unexpected flattery</h1>
      <p>There was an unexpected compliment for Saxon on Thursday in an announcement of a new
         release of Per Bothner's Qexo implementation of XQuery. He slipped in the remark:
         "some tests are significantly faster than Saxon". More evidence that our competitors
         regard Saxon as the product they need to beat, and at the same time an admission that
         for most tests, Saxon runs faster than this particular engine. Since most developers
         (including me) can usually get their own product to run faster than anyone else can,
         that's a nice testimonial.</p>
      <p>It's impressive though that Per is running all 16000 XQTS tests in 75 seconds. It
         takes me a lot longer, but I don't separate the time spent running the query from
         the time spent parsing and canonicalizing the actual results and reference results,
         and then comparing them. I must find out what Per is actually measuring. I should
         also follow Qexo's lead in publishing my test driver: at present it needs a bit of
         packaging work to make it run anywhere other than my own laptop.</p>
