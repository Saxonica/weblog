      <h1>Progress on XQuery Update</h1>
      <p>I've now got the basics of XQuery update working, with no major difficulties. Things
         still to be tackled after Christmas:</p>
      <p>(1) the (so-called) transform expression (which in its latest incarnation is actually
         a modify-copy-return expression). I don't expect any major difficulties here.</p>
      <p>(2) building nodes that are constructed during the query (using element constructors,
         etc) to use a data model implementation other than the TinyTree (because the TinyTree
         isn't going to be made updateable). Of course this will only happen if the query is
         using updates, and ideally it should only happen if the tree in question is being
         subjected to updates, which in principle is something I could determine using the
         path-analysis code that's used to underpin document projection. (But what is actually
         the effect of updating such a node, for example "insert &lt;a/&gt; into &lt;b/&gt;"? Yes, it creates
         the tree &lt;b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, but is the updated result available in any way to the calling
         application? Perhaps I should optimize this out as a no-op?)</p>
      <p>(3) now that the linked tree model is updatable, some changes are needed to ensure
         that it handles node identity correctly. I haven't worked out all the details on this
         yet. In theory, if an attribute is replaced by another attribute, the new attribute
         must have a different identity from the old; at the moment in the linked tree the
         identity of an attribute is determined by the combination of the identity of the containing
         element and the name of the attribute, so that will need to change.</p>
      <p>(4) Revalidation: that is, checking after a set of updates that the tree is still
         valid, allocating type annotations, and expanding any defaulted elements or attributes.
         The difficulty with this is that unlike the validate{} expression in XQuery, it has
         to be done in-situ, that is, without changing node identities. The Saxon schema validator
         is designed to work as a push (SAX-like) pipeline, and it's not obvious how to change
         it to work on a tree in-situ. It probably requires some kind of mechanism for retaining
         node identities as they pass through the pipeline, so that the receiver at the end
         of the pipe can apply updates to the original nodes.</p>
      <p>(5) API and command line design. I still have to work out the best way of handling
         rewrite of updated documents back to disk. From the command line the default should
         probably be to update the source document in-situ while saving the original with a
         .bak extension. Clearly there are cases where the source can't be updated, for example
         if it's read via HTTP - what should happen then? Answers on a postcard please...</p>
      <p>(6) Nearly forgot a few more loose ends: </p>
      <p>(6a) I haven't yet implemented the rules for testing the compatibility of updates
         on the pending update list</p>
      <p>(6b) In turn that might create some issues concerning the possibility of transient
         inconsistencies in the tree. For example, handling the case where there's a delete
         on an existing attribute and an insert of a new attribute with the same name.</p>
      <p>(6c) There are probably more complexities with namespace consistency than I'm yet
         handling. In fact, I suspect there are more complexities in this area that the spec
         is yet handling.</p>
