      <h1>FtanML - A new markup language</h1>
      <p>FtanML
         is a notation for data and documents designed to combine the
         simplicity of JSON with the expressive power of XML. Key aims are
         ease of reading and writing by human beings, and ease of processing
         by software in conventional programming languages.</p>
      <p>It
         is named after Ftan, the village in the Swiss Alps where it was
         created, during a two-week summer school course in August 2012. The
         tutors on the course were Michael Kay and Stephanie Haupt, and the
         students were Max Altgelt, Julien Bergner, Lukas Graf, Dominik Helm,
         Axel Kroschk, Uwe von Lpke, My-Tien Nguyen, Sebastian Memer,
         Suhanyaa Nitkunanantharajah, Jan Landelin Pawellek, and Martin
         Schmitt.</p>
      <p><b>The
            FtanML Grammar</b></p>
      <p>value
         ::= array | element |  string | number | "true" | "false" |
         "null"</p>
      <p>string
         ::= (like a JSON string)</p>
      <p>number
         ::= (like a JSON number)</p>
      <p>
         array
         ::= "[" (value ("," value)* )? "]"</p>
      <p>
         element
         ::= "&lt;" element-name? attribute* ("|" content)?  "&gt;"</p>
      <p>
         element-name
         ::=  string | name</p>
      <p>attribute
         ::= (string | name) "=" value</p>
      <p>
         content
         ::= (content-char | escaped-char | element ) *</p>
      <p>
         content-char
         ::= any character except \, &lt;, &gt;, and control characters</p>
      <p>
         escaped-char
         ::= as in JSON strings with the addition of "\&lt;", "\&gt;"
         (to escape "&lt;" and "&gt;")</p>
      <p>
         name
         ::= [\p{L}\p{N}:_$]+ 
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>The
            FtanML Data Model</b></p>
      <p>
         A Value
         is either an Array, an Element, a string, a number, a boolean or
         null.</p>
      <p>
         An
         Array is a sequence of Values.</p>
      <p>
         An
         Element is a set of attributes. An attribute is a name-value pair,
         where the name is any string and the value is any Value. (An element
         is thus equivalent to a JSON Object.)</p>
      <p>
         Two
         particular attributes are treated specially in the surface syntax,
         but not in the data model. The attribute named "name" represents
         what in XML is called the "element type name", and the syntax
         &lt;name="hr"&gt; may therefore be abbreviated to &lt;hr&gt;. The
         attribute named "content" represents what in XML is modelled as
         the children of the element, and its value is an array consisting of
         a sequence of elements and strings (with adjacent strings and
         zero-length strings not permitted). The content of an element is
         normally written in the form &lt;p|Here is &lt;b|bold&gt; text&gt;
         but in data model terms this is equivalent to &lt;p content=["Here
         is ", &lt;b content=["bold"]&gt;, " text"]&gt;.</p>
      <p>
         <b>Examples</b></p>
      <p>
         A
         JSON-like array:</p>
      <p>
         [1, 2,
         "abc", [1, 2]]</p>
      <p>
         A
         JSON-like map:</p>
      <p>
         &lt;x=1
         y=2 label="box" "corner coordinates"=[[0,1], [0,3], [1,3],
         [1,1]]&gt;</p>
      <p>
         Note:
         the attribute names do not require quotes unless they contain special
         characters not allowed in a name. The presence or absence of quotes
         is not exposed in the data model. The quotes around attribute values
         are required if the value is a string, but not otherwise.</p>
      <p>
         An
         XML-like element:</p>
      <p>
         &lt;para|Here
         is some &lt;b|bold&gt; text&gt;</p>
      <p>
         The
         equivalent of the XML "start tag" is the material before the
         vertical bar; to the right of the vertical bar is the (optional)
         content; the end tag is reduced to a right angle bracket.</p>
      <p>
         An
         XML-like element with attributes, and an empty element:</p>
      <p>
         &lt;para
         id="p123"|Line 1&lt;br&gt;Line 2&gt;</p>
      <p>
         A
         element named "list" containing three unnamed elements:</p>
      <p>
         &lt;list|&lt;|red&gt;&lt;|green&gt;&lt;|blue&gt;&gt;</p>
      <p>
         An
         element having a class attribute but no name:</p>
      <p>
         &lt;p|This
         is &lt;class="u"|underlined&gt;&gt;</p>
      <p>
         An
         element with no name, attributes, or content:</p>
      <p>
         &lt;&gt;</p>
      <p><b>Postscript</b></p>
      <p>By the end of the course we implemented a parser for FtanML (using JavaCC), which
         generated Java objects corresponding to the object model. We also implemented serialization
         of the object model to FtanML, JSON, and XML, and wrote some parser tests and test
         applications for the object model.</p>
      <p>Analyzing what we did, I think there are two things FtanML does particularly well:</p>
      <p>(a) it adds mixed content to JSON at the lexical level, without adding any complexity
         to the data model. So programming against JSON is just as easy as it was before, but
         "document-like" information is no longer excluded</p>
      <p>(b) It provides a document-oriented markup language that is both richer and simpler
         than XML. Richer, because it generalizes what attributes can contain (not just strings,
         but numbers, booleans, arrays, and elements), and simpler because (i) there is less
         syntactic baggage (&lt;b|bold text&gt; instead of &lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt;; simpler escape mechanism),
         and (ii) it cuts out a lot of the rarely used but complicating features such as comments,
         processing instructions, CDATA sections, entity references, XML declarations, etc.)</p>
      <p>Of course, the fact that we have a better mousetrap will not itself cause the world
         to beat at our door; but I hope the ideas will prove influential.</p>
      <p>There are some things we didn't tackle or decide; here is a list of what one might
         want to do next.</p>
      <p><i>Parent pointers in the data model</i></p>
      <p>Should an element (=map, = JSON object) have a pointer to its parent? In the XML world
         we expect this, in the JSON world we don't. There are advantages and disadvantages
         both ways. I think this remains an open question.</p>
      <p><i>Whitespace</i></p>
      <p>In element content, is whitespace significant? I think it's important that it should
         be possible to include both significant and insignificant whitespace, and that the
         two should be clearly distinguished. One suggestion is that any sequence of whitespace
         characters that follows a backslash should be considered insignificant. Another is
         the reverse: whitespace is normalized/collapsed except for any whitespace character
         that is escaped with "\".</p>
      <p><i>Namespaces</i></p>
      <p>I think there are three possible approaches to namespaces. (i) do nothing, as in JSON.
         (ii) do namespaces the XML way. (iii) provide a minimal namespaces facility.</p>
      <p>Since FtanML generally adopts the approach of doing what is right without concern
         for compatibility, my preference is (iii). I think a simple namespace scheme might
         work as follows:</p>
      <p>The "absolute name" of an element is in the form ":com.saxonica.project.para", that
         is a name rather like a Java class name using inverse DNS names by convention to achieve
         uniqueness. The element name can always be written literally in this form. Alternatively,
         it can be written as a short name "para" in which case it is implicitly in the same
         namespace as its parent element. The name that appears in the data model is always
         the absolute name; the short name is merely an authoring convenience. Attribute names
         are in no namespace unless they are written in full as absolute names.</p>
      <p><i>Path/query language</i></p>
      <p>We clearly need an XPath-like language to address into FtanML documents, and the data
         model is sufficiently different from XDM that XPath itself won't really do the job.
         For example, the arrays in the data model are subtly different from XDM sequences
         (a singleton item is not the same as an array containing that item) and this has considerable
         implications.</p>
      <p><i>Schema language</i></p>
      <p>Given time and effort, I would propose a schema language for FtanML that is rule-based
         and that incorporates both predicate-based validation, type assignment, and grammar
         rules. That is, the ability to say "for an element that matches this pattern, the
         following rules must be satisfied", where the rules include the ability to specify
         a named type, to add restrictions such as min and max values and regex patterns, or
         if the type is "element", to specify the required content of the element as a grammar.</p>
      <p><b>Finally</b></p>
      <p>I don't know if FtanML will go any further. But developing it was a great experience
         and a good way of spending a couple of weeks with a group of very talented students.
         I think it was a good learning experience for them; and perhaps, just perhaps, it
         will sow some ideas in the community that will influence the future of markup languages.</p>
