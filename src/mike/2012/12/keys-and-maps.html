      <h1>Keys and maps</h1>
      <p>I've felt for a while there ought to be some kind of connection between keys (in the
         xsl:key sense) and maps.
         </p>
      <p>
         Keys are great, but their limitations are frustrating. There's no way of enumerating
         the entries in a key, there's no way of using them for grouping or sorting. If you're
         going to the effort of building an index, then one feels it ought to be possible to
         get a higher return on this investment.
         </p>
      <p>
         I've been trying out a fairly simple way of achieving this.
         </p>
      <p>
         Firstly, to the xsl:key declaration we add the option saxon:range-key="yes". The main
         effect of this is that we build the resulting index as a TreeMap rather than a HashMap,
         which means that the keys are sorted.
         </p>
      <p>
         Then, we add a single extension function: saxon:key-map('keyname', doc, min, max).
         The effect of this function is to return a map. The keys in the map are the values
         of the "use" expression in the key declaration; the map contains all entries for this
         key relevant to the document supplied in the doc argument; and min and max are the
         minimum and maximum (inclusive) values of the key - either can be supplied as an empty
         sequence to indicate "no lower/upper limit". Perhaps for convenience we could also
         have a version of the function in which only the first two arguments are supplied.
         </p>
      <p>
         So, for example, given a list of transactions with a date attribute, you would declare
         a key like this:
         </p>
      <p>
         &lt;xsl:key name="transactions-by-date" match="transaction" use="@date" saxon:range-key="yes"/&gt;
         </p>
      <p>
         and then the call
         </p>
      <p>
         saxon:range-key('transactions-by-date', doc('transactions.xml'), '2012-12-01', '2012-12-31')
         </p>
      <p>
         would return a map containing all the transactions for December. With the result bound
         to variable $map, map:keys() returns the dates of these transactions, and $map($x)
         returns the transactions for a specific date. It's a shame there isn't a nicer way
         to iterate over the contents of a map (we're still working on that one), but by presenting
         the result as a map we get access to all the map functionality without having to invent
         a lot of new functions just for this use case.
         </p>
      <p>
         We're guaranteeing that for this particular kind of map, keys() will return the keys
         in sorted order. (Perhaps that's a facility that should also be available for other
         kinds of map? I don't think this design precludes that.)
         </p>
      <p>
         Let me know what you think.
