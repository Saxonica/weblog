      <h1>Alphacodes for Sequence Types</h1>
      <p>In the next releases of Saxon and Saxon-JS we have devised a compact notation for
         representation of <code><b>SequenceType</b></code> syntax in the exported SEF file. This note is to document this syntax.</p>
      <p>The main aims in devising the syntax were compactness, together with fast generation
         and fast parsing. In addition it has the benefit that some operations are possible
         on the raw lexical form without doing a full parse.</p>
      <p>The syntax actually handles <b>ItemTypes</b> as well as <b>SequenceTypes</b>; and in addition, it can handle the two examples of <b>NodeTests</b> that are not item types, namely<i> *:local</i> and <i>uri:*</i>. It can therefore be used in the SEF wherever a <b>SequenceType</b>, <b>ItemType</b>, or <b>NodeTest</b> is required.</p>
      <p>The first character of an alphacode is the occurrence indicator. This is one of: *
         (zero or more), + (one or more), ? (zero or one), 0 (exactly zero), 1 (exactly one).
         If the first character is not one of these, then "1" is assumed; but the occurrence
         indicator is generally omitted only when representing an item type as distinct from
         a sequence type.</p>
      <p>The occurrence indicator is immediately followed by the "primary alphacode" for the
         item type. These are chosen so that <i>alphacode(T)</i> is a prefix of <i>alphacode(U)</i> if and only if <i>T</i> is a supertype of <i>U</i>. For example, the primary alphacode for <b>xs:integer</b> is "ADI", and the primary alphacode for <b>xs:decima</b>l is "AD", reflecting the fact that <b>xs:integer</b> is a subtype of <b>xs:decimal</b>. The primary alphacodes are as follows:</p>
      <p>"" (zero-length string): item()</p>
      <p>A: xs:anyAtomicType<br />
         AB: xs:boolean</p>
      <p>AS: xs:string<br />
         ASN: xs:normalizedString<br />
         ASNT: xs:token<br />
         ASNTL: xs:language<br />
         ASNTM: xs:NMTOKEN<br />
         ASNTN: xs:Name<br />
         ASNTNC: xs:NCName<br />
         ASNTNCI: xs:ID<br />
         ASNTNCE: xs:ENTITY<br />
         ASNTNCR: xs:IDREF</p>
      <p>AQ: xs:QName<br />
         AU: xs:anyURI<br />
         AA: xs:date<br />
         AM: xs:dateTime<br />
         AMP: xs:dateTimeStamp<br />
         AT: xs:time<br />
         AR: xs:duration<br />
         ARD: xs:dayTimeDuration<br />
         ARY: xs:yearMonthDuration<br />
         AG: xs:gYear<br />
         AH: xs:gYearMonth<br />
         AI: xs:gMonth<br />
         AJ: xs:gMonthDay<br />
         AK: xs:gDay</p>
      <p>AD: xs:decimal<br />
         ADI: xs:integer<br />
         ADIN: xs:nonPositiveInteger<br />
         ADINN: xs:negativeInteger<br />
         ADIP: xs:nonNegativeInteger<br />
         ADIPP: xs:positiveInteger<br />
         ADIPL: xs:unsignedLong<br />
         ADIPLI: xs:unsignedInt<br />
         ADIPLIS: xs:unsignedShort<br />
         ADIPLISB: xs:unsignedByte<br />
         ADIL: xs:long<br />
         ADILI: xs:int<br />
         ADILIS: xs:short<br />
         ADILISB: xs:byte</p>
      <p>AO: xs:double<br />
         AF: xs:float<br />
         A2: xs:base64Binary<br />
         AX: xs:hexBinary<br />
         AZ: xs:untypedAtomic</p>
      <p>N: node()<br />
         NE: element(*)<br />
         NA: attribute(*)<br />
         NT: text()<br />
         NC: comment()<br />
         NP: processing-instruction()<br />
         ND: document-node()<br />
         NN: namespace-node()</p>
      <p>F: function(*)<br />
         FM: map(*)<br />
         FA: array(*)</p>
      <p>E: xs:error</p>
      <p>X: external (wrapped) object<br />
         XJ: external Java object<br />
         XN: external .NET object<br />
         XS: external Javascript object</p>
      <p>Every item belongs to one or more of these types, and there is always a "most specific"
         type, which is the one that we choose.</p>
      <p>Following the occurrence indicator and primary alphacode are zero or more supplementary
         codes. Each is preceded by a single space, is identified by a single letter, and is
         followed by a parameter value. For example the sequence type "element(BOOK)" is coded
         as "1NE nQ{}BOOK" - here 1 is the occurrence indicator, NE indicates an element node,
         and nQ{}BOOK is the required element name. The identifying letter here is "n". The
         supplementary codes (which may appear in any order) are as follows:</p>
      <p>n - Name, as a URI-qualified name. Used for node names when the primary alphacode
         is one of (NE, NA, NP). Also used for the XSD type name when the type is a user-defined
         atomic or union type: the basic alphacode then represents the lowest common supertype
         that is a built-in type.  (Note: we assume that type names are globally unique. This
         cannot be guaranteed when deploying a SEF file: the schema at the receiving end might
         vary from that of the sender.) Also used for the class name in the case of external
         object types (in this case the namespace part will always be "Q{}"). Note that strictly
         speaking, the forms <i>*:name</i> and <i>name:*</i> can appear in a <b>NameTest</b>, but never in a <b>SequenceType</b>. However, they can be represented in alphacodes using the syntax <b>"n*:name"</b> and <b>"nQ{uri}*"</b> respectively. The syntax <b>"~localname"</b> is used for a name in the XSD namespace. </p>
      <p>c - Node content type (XSD type annotation), as a URI-qualified name optionally followed
         by "?" to indicate nillable. The syntax "~localname" is used for a name in the XSD
         namespace. Optionally present when the basic code is (NE, NA); omitted for NE when
         the content is <b>xs:untyped</b>, and for NA when the content is <b>xs:untypedAtomic</b>. Only relevant for schema-aware code.</p>
      <p>k - Key type, present when the basic code is FM (i.e. for maps), omitted if the key
         type is <b>xs:anyAtomicType</b>. The value is the alphacode of the key type, enclosed in square brackets: it will
         always start with "1A".</p>
      <p>v - Value type, present when when the basic code is (FM, FA) (i.e. for maps and arrays),
         omitted if the value type is <b>item()*</b>. The value is the alphacode of the value type, enclosed in square brackets. For example
         the alphacode for <b>array(xs:string+)* </b>is "*FA v[+AS]".</p>
      <p>r - Return type, always present for functions. The value is the alphacode of the return
         type, enclosed in square brackets.</p>
      <p>a - Argument types, always present for functions. The value is an array of alphacodes,
         enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. For example, the alphacode for
         the function <b>fn:dateTime#2</b> (with signature <i>($arg1 as xs:date?, $arg2 as xs:time?) as xs:dateTime?)</i> is "1F r[?AM] a[?AA,?AT]"</p>
      <p>m - Member types of an anonymous union type. The value is an array of alphacodes for
         the member types (these will always be atomic types), enclosed in square brackets
         and comma-separated. The basic code in this case will be "A", indicating xs:anyAtomicType.
         This is not used for the built-in union type xs:numeric, nor for user-defined atomic
         types defined in a schema; it is used only for anonymous union types defined using
         the Saxon extension syntax "union(a, b, c)".</p>
      <p>e - Element type of a document-node() type, present optionally when the basic code
         is ND. The value is an alphacode, which will always start with "1NE".</p>
      <p>t - Components of a tuple type (Saxon extension). The value is an array of tokens,
         enclosed in square brackets, where each token comprises the name of the component
         (an NCName), a colon, and the alphacode of the component type.</p>
      <p>i, u, d - Venn type. The item type is the intersection, union, or difference of two
         item types. The letter "i", "u", or "d" indicates intersection, union, or difference
         respectively, followed by a list of (currently always two) item types enclosed in
         square brackets and separated by a comma. The principal type will typically be "N"
         or "NE". Saxon uses venn types internally to give a more precise inferred type for
         expressions; it is probably largely unused at run-time, and can therefore be safely
         ignored when reading a SEF file.</p>
      <p>Named union types have a basic alphacode of "A", followed by the name of the union
         type in the form "A nQ{uri}local". The syntax "~localname" is used for a name in the
         XSD namespace, so the built-in union types xs:numeric and xs:error are represented
         as "A n~numeric" and "A n~error" respectively.</p>
      <p><i>TODO: the documentation for union types is not aligned with the current implementation</i></p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p>0 - empty-sequence()</p>
      <p>1AS - xs:string</p>
      <p>1N - node()</p>
      <p>1 - item()</p>
      <p>* - item()*</p>
      <p>1NE nQ{}item - element(item)</p>
      <p>1ND e[1NE nQ{}item] - document-node(element(item))</p>
      <p>*FM k[1AS] v[?AS] - map(xs:string, xs:string?)*</p>
      <p>1F a[?AS,*AO] r[1AB] - function(xs:string?, xs:double*) as xs:boolean</p>
