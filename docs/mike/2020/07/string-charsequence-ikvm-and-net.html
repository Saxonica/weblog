      <p>A couple of years ago Jeroen Frijters announced that he would no longer be working
         on new IKVM developments (IKVM is the technology we use to make Saxon, which is written
         in Java, run on .NET). At one level that's not a problem: the tool works brilliantly
         and we can continue to use it. However, it doesn't support .NET Core, and Microsoft
         have announced that .NET 5 will be based on .NET Core, so that creates the risk that
         Saxon on .NET will hit a brick wall.</p>
      <p>Various smart people are working on trying to pick up IKVM where Jeroen left off,
         but I don't particularly want to bet the business on them being successful. Jeroen
         produced brilliant software but he left very little in the way of documentation or
         test material, so it's a hard act to follow.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Microsoft seem to be back-pedalling on their original promise that .NET
         5 would support Java interoperability. They've never given any indication of how it
         would do so, despite much speculation.</p>
      <p>So we've been looking at alternative ways of taking Saxon on .NET forward into the
         future, and one of those is source code conversion. I've been looking at tools such
         as Tangible, which does a good job to a degree: they don't tackle the difficult parts
         of the problem where Java and C# are most different, but they give a very good insight
         into understanding what the difficult parts of the problem are going to be.</p>
      <p>And one of those difficult parts, which I'm focussing on at the moment, is the <b>CharSequence</b> problem. CharSequence is a Java interface that we use very extensively, and there's
         no equivalent on .NET. Unlike other dependencies on Java classes and interfaces, this
         one is impossible to emulate directly, because java.lang.String implements CharSequence,
         and there's no way we can make System.String on .NET do the same.</p>
      <p>The reason we use CharSequence, as with any interface, is so that we can have multiple
         implementations with different performance characteristics. To take a simple example,
         one of our implementations is CompressedWhitespace. A great deal of the text in an
         XML document is made up of whitespace, which sadly cannot be killed at birth: using
         a customised representation for strings that contain only whitespace gives a significant
         space saving. (And space savings also turn into speed improvements, given that execution
         time these days is dominated by how long it takes to get data in and out of the CPU's
         internal cache).</p>
      <p>Given that CharSequence has no equivalent on .NET, it occurred to me to ask how IKVM
         deals with it. Although Jeroen never wrote much documentaton, he did write a lot of
         blog posts about interesting design problems, and sure enough it seems that he gave
         this a lot of attention back in 2003 (how time flies when you're having fun). I thought
         that he might use an implementation of CharSequence that wraps a System.String, but
         it seems he rejected that approach in favour of a mechanism of what he calls "ghost
         interfaces". There's a lot of detail, but the bottom line seems to be that the code:</p>
      <pre><code>CharSequence seq = "foo";
seq.charAt(1);</code></pre>
      <p>is compiled to .NET as:</p>
      <pre><code>System.Object seq = "foo";
if(seq instanceof System.String)
  ((System.String)seq).charAt(1);
else if(seq instanceof CharSequence)
  ((CharSequence)seq).charAt(1);
else
  throw new IncompatibleClassChangeError()</code></pre>
      <p>That looks pretty horrifying, and I've belatedly realised that it could account for
         a lot of our observations on .NET performance over the years.</p>
      <p>When we first built Saxon on .NET, the performance overhead compared with Java was
         around 30%, which was quite acceptable. In recent years we've seen it getting worse,
         with some workloads showing a 300% slow-down, and despite considerable effort we've
         been at a loss to explain why. Synthetic benchmarks on IKVM continued to show a 30%
         overhead, but for Saxon the figure was far worse. We looked hard without success to
         find a hot-spot, something we were doing that IKVM handled particularly badly, but
         the slow-down seemed to be right across the board. I'm now prepared to conjecture
         that it's all down to our use of CharSequence - because CharSequence.charAt() is something
         we do very extensively, throughout the product.</p>
      <p>When data arrives in Saxon from a SAX parser, the content of text nodes arrives in
         char[] arrays, while the content of attributes arrives in String objects. And we keep
         it that way: in the TinyTree, text nodes are effectively slices of a char[] array,
         and attributes are Strings. All the operations that we perform on text, including
         performance-critical operations such as equality matching, sorting, and string-to-number
         conversion, therefore need to work on either representation, and that's essentially
         why we use CharSequence. In general, we don't want to spend time converting data between
         different representations so we can perform different operations on it.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(In recent releases, though, we've started using a different representation for operations
         where we need to count Unicode codepoints rather than UTF-16 chars. For regular expressions,
         and some other operations such as translate(), we first convert the string to a UnicodeString,
         which is our own interface that supports direct codepoint addressing, with internal
         implementations using 8, 16, or 32 bits per character depending on the widest character
         present in the string).</p>
      <p>So if CharSequence is a problem, what should we do instead? Is there any other way
         we can implement operations such as collation comparison and string-to-number conversion
         efficiently without first converting the data to a common internal format?</p>
      <p>I think part of the solution might be for these operations to be written to use codepoint
         iterators. Iterating over a string using an IntIterator that delivers codepoints is
         probably just as efficient as using a for-loop with charAt(), and it's possible to
         create an IntIterator over any string representation efficiently (meaning, without
         copying the actual characters).</p>
      <p>This suggests the following broad approach:</p>
      <p>(a) For attributes, continue to use Strings</p>
      <p>(b) For text nodes on the Receiver pipeline and in the TinyTree, use an interface
         similar to CharSequence - let's call it UniString - that allows multiple implementations,
         but that doesn't have the magic property that String can be used directly as an implementation.
         (Instead, there will be an implementation of UniString that wraps a String).</p>
      <p>(c) For operations on strings and string-like values, use a codepoint iterator wherever
         possible.</p>
      <p>This is a gross simplification: we're dealing with half a million lines of code that's
         all concerned with string handling, so the detail is horrendous. But having a simplified
         description of the problem and the solution helps greatly when you're hacking through
         the jungle.</p>
