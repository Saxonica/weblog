      <p>The set of interfaces and classes used in the Java code to represent XSD and XDM types
         has become something of a nightmare. This article is an attempt to explain it. When
         you don't understand something well, you can often improve your understanding by trying
         to explain it to others, so that's what I shall attempt to do.
         </p>
      <p>
         The first complication is that we have to model schema types and item types, and these
         are overlapping categories.
         </p>
      <p>
         Schema types - types as the term is used in XSD - are either simple types or complex
         types; simple types are either atomic types, union types, or list types. We can forget
         about complex types for the time being as they are relatively unproblematic.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         With simple types, we should mention in passing that one of the problems is that while
         processing a schema, we don't always immediately know what the variety of a simple
         type is; if it's derived from a base type and we haven't yet analysed the base type,
         then we park it as a "SimpleTypeDefinition" to be turned into an AtomicType, UnionType,
         or ListType later - which means that all references to the type need to be updated.
         </p>
      <p>
         As well as their use in schema processing, schema types are used as type annotations
         on nodes in XDM, and they also appear in XPath expressions as the target of a "cast"
         or "castable" expression.
         </p>
      <p>
         Item types are purely an XDM concept, and they include atomic types, node types, function
         types, map types, array types. Item types when combined with an occurrence indicator
         form a Sequence type. Sequence types are used in XPath in declaring the types of variables,
         parameters, and function results; they are also used in "instance of" and "treat as"
         expressions.
         </p>
      <p>
         Atomic types are both schema types (more specifically, simple types) and item types.
         Not every schema type is an item type (complex types aren't, list types aren't), and
         not every item type is a schema type (node types and function types aren't). The categories
         overlap, so it's not surprising that the Java class hierarchy is complicated.
         </p>
      <p>
         Union types add another complication. A simple union of atomic types (for example
         the union of xs:date and xs:dateTime) is useful as an item type, for example to define
         the type of a function argument or variable. But XSD union types aren't always simple
         unions of atomic types: they can also include list types, and they can define restrictions
         beyond those present in the member types. So XDM defines the concept of a "pure union
         type", which is a simple union of atomic types; pure union types are the only kind
         that can be used as item types. For convenience it's useful to have a term that embraces
         atomic types and pure union types: the XDM specifications call these "generalized
         atomic types", and in Saxon they are referred to as "plain types". Again, these overlapping
         categories make it very hard to get the Java class hierarchy right.
         </p>
      <p>
         Simple types form a lattice; at the top of this lattice is the most general type "xs:anySimpleType",
         and at the bottom is the "void" type "xs:error" (void because it has no instances).
         These "edge case" types are simple types, but they don't fit cleanly into the classification
         of union types, list types, and atomic types.
         </p>
      <p>
         Item types also overlap with XSLT patterns, and with the node tests used in axis steps.
         Constructs such as element(*) and text() are both node tests (suitable for use in
         patterns and axis steps) and item types. Not every item type is a node test (for example,
         array(*) isn't), and not every node test is an item type (for example, *:local isn't).
         Again, we have two intersecting categories. If we draw the Venn diagram of simple
         types, item types, and node tests, we find that simple tests don't overlap with node
         tests, but all other combinations have an intersection.
         </p>
      <p>
         There's another dimension that we try to capture in the Java class hierarchy: we try
         to distinguish built-in types from user-defined types. There are built-in atomic types
         (xs:integer), built-in list types (xs:NMTOKENS), and built-in union types (xs:numeric);
         and there are also used-defined types in each of the three varieties. Capturing two
         dimensions of classification in a class hierarchy typically introduces multiple inheritance
         and complicates the hierarchy.
         </p>
      <p>
         There's also a lot of complexity concerned with the relationship of schema types to
         other kinds of schema component. Again at this level we try to distinguish used-defined
         schema components (those derived from declarations in an XSD source document) from
         built-in schema components (which include not only simple types, but also complex
         types such as xs:anyType and xs:untyped). We distinguish "schema components" as defined
         in the XSD specification (which include not only schema types, but also element declarations,
         attribute declarations, identity constraints etc) and "schema structures" which are
         essentially constructs in a source XSD document; but looking at the code, nearly everything
         you find in a schema seems to be both a "schema component" and a "schema structure"
         and I'm having trouble seeing exactly what the difference between the two categories
         is.
         </p>
      <p>
         The straw that broke the camel's back and made me examine whether refactoring is needed
         was the introduction of locally-declared union types with the syntax "union(xs:date,
         xs:time)". These are clearly union types, but they aren't built-in, and they don't
         correspond to declarations in any source schema, so they don't fit neatly into the
         existing classification of built-in versus user-defined.
         </p>
      <p>
         We've got an awful lot of multiple inheritance in this hierarchy, and the accepted
         wisdom is that if you've got a lot of multiple inheritance, then you need to do some
         refactoring, and replace some of it with delegation.
         </p>
      <p>
         We've got a model for that in the way we handle XSLT match patterns. Although node-tests
         are a subset of patterns, we don't treat node-tests as a subclass of patterns in the
         Java class hierarchy; rather, the class hierarchy for patterns includes a NodeTestPattern
         which contains a reference to a NodeTest. Similarly, atomic types are a subset of
         schema types, but that doesn't mean they need to implement SchemaType in the Java
         class hierarchy; rather the class hierarchy for SchemaTypes could include an AtomicSchemaType
         which contains a reference to an AtomicType.
         </p>
      <p>
         Let's see what we can do.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>UPDATE 2020-02-18</b></p>
      <p>Well: I had a good go at refactoring this; but the new scheme was getting just as
         complex as the old, so I decided to revert all the work.
         </p>
      <p>
         I tried to split the classes representing simple types into two: the "compile time"
         information used during XSD schema compilation, and the "executable" types used actively
         for validation. But I ended up with just as many classes (or more), and just as much
         multiple inheritance. I did manage to eliminate the messy process whereby a SimpleTypeDefinition
         is converted to an AtomicType, ListType, or UnionType as soon as we know its variety
         (i.e. when the reference to its base type is resolved -- it can be a forwards reference),
         but I found that doesn't open the door to any wider simplification.
