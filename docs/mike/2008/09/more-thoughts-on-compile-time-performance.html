      <p>Another user, Rudolf Weinmann, has sent me some samples of generated code (XSLT this
         time) with a request to take a look at compile-time performance issues. Here we're
         dealing with a single stylesheet module, 22K lines long, more or less a single fill-in-the-blanks
         template rule. It takes about 3900ms to compile (5000ms under Saxon-SA), and the new
         switch to suppress optimization reduces this to about 1180ms. So optimization is the
         culprit here. The optimizer is actually making quite a few significant improvements
         to the code, but because the source document is small and the transformation time
         is only 75ms, the improvements are not worth the effort of making them. Also, because
         this code is being regenerated and recompiled frequently, compile-time milliseconds
         are just as costly as run-time milliseconds.</p>
      <p>So the switch will be useful here. But I hate performance improvements that depend
         on the user setting a switch, because 99% of users will never discover the switch
         is there (and this probably includes users who run benchmarks and publish the results...).
         So, are there opportunities to improve the compile-time performance of the optimizer?
         You bet there are.</p>
      <p>It turns out that the optimizer spends a lot of its time chasing around the expression
         tree searching for things. Saxon tries to minimize this by storing redundant data
         on the tree, and computing it lazily when first required. But this strategy has its
         limitations, because the optimizer is constantly rearranging the tree, and this invalidates
         such cached results. In fact, at one time Saxon maintained parent pointers in the
         expression tree (which is a kind of redundancy), but these were eliminated because
         of the difficulty of keeping them consistent in the face of tree rewrites.</p>
      <p>In this particular example (with one rather large template rule containing a lot of
         local variables), a lot of time is spent searching the tree to look for references
         to the local variables. A fairly simple change - stopping the search when you find
         an expression that has no dependencies on local variables - gives a significant saving
         (down from 3900ms to 2400ms in Saxon-B). Unfortunately it also increases the optimizer's
         dependence on the correctness of the lazily-evaluated flag saying "this expression
         has dependencies on local variables" - and I have already found cases where this flag
         is not being correctly re-evaluated after a rewrite of a portion of the tree.</p>
      <p>
         It's tempting to say that a node on the expression tree that binds a
         local variable should contain a list of references to all the uses of
         that variable. This would certainly save a lot of the searching. But
         it's really hard to maintain such a list, for example if an
         intermediate expression is removed from the tree because it turns out
         to be unreachable or to contribute nothing to the final result.</p>
      <p>So, we can improve performance by adding more redundant data to the tree, but every
         time we do so, we risk introducing bugs when rewrites fail to update the redundant
         data. A tricky engineering trade-off. It's no use hoping that the bugs will be eliminated
         by testing - experience shows that with optimization, it's impossible to devise a
         large enough set of test cases to get all the bugs out before release. They have to
         be eliminated by design. And not storing redundant data (and taking a performance
         hit) is one way of doing that.</p>
      <p>Some parts of the optimization process get around the problem by maintaining redundant
         data not on the tree itself, but as temporary data within the ExpressionVisitor that
         is used to navigate the tree. Perhaps there is scope for increasing the use of this
         technique?</p>
      <p>Or perhaps we ought simply to make it much faster to walk the expression tree? This
         after all is what the TinyTree does at the level of walking instance documents. The
         difference, though, is that the TinyTree data structure is explicitly taking advantage
         of the immutability of the tree. Here the fact that the expression tree is changing
         is the cause of all the trouble.</p>
      <p>Another approach would be to manage cache invalidation more robustly. The expression
         tree is in fact a forest, each root (called a Container) representing a top-level
         object like a function, template, global variable, or the main query body. Every time
         we change the tree within a Container, we could increment a version number for the
         Container, and all cached properties within a Container could be associated with the
         version number of the Container at the time they were created. This eliminates the
         need to preserve consistency at a fine-grained level; the only requirement is that
         (a) anyone who makes a change to the tree should up the version, and (b) anyone who
         uses cached properties should check the version and recompute if necessary. If we
         had a robust mechanism like this, we could afford to risk holding more redundant data
         on the tree.</p>
