      <p>I'm doing what looks like a fairly simple project to upgrade an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet.
         It's XSLT 1.0 because it has to run in the browser, but fortunately it doesn't really
         need any 2.0 features. The old version of the stylesheet worked with XML files in
         format A, described by a DTD. The new version of the stylesheet has to produce the
         same HTML output, but this time from XML files in format B, described by an XSD schema.
         The stylesheet is about 650 lines long. A quick visual inspection of the XML files
         reveals that the two formats are very similar: clearly format B is a revised design
         of format A, but it's not immediately clear what the differences are.</p>
      <p>How do we go about this project? I'll report progress here as I go along, no doubt
         there will be mistakes along the way but I hope they will be instructive.</p>
      <p>First, format B uses a namespace while format A didn't. So the first thing to do is
         add a prefix to every element name in a pattern or path expression. Tediously, by
         hand, because I can't think of any way of automating it that will take less than the
         20 minutes it takes to do it manually. It would be nice to use XSLT 2.0's default-xpath-namespace
         attribute, but our hands are tied.</p>
      <p>Of course, there's a big risk I miss some names, and the likely consequence will be
         missing output in the HTML, which is going to be hard to track down. So I decide to
         (temporarily) make the stylesheet schema-aware, in the hope that some of the bad path
         expressions will be detected at compile time. I change all the match patterns from,
         for example match="abc" to match="schema-element(p:abc)".</p>
      <p>First run through Saxon. A couple of silly syntax errors, of course; then some errors
         from the schema analysis.</p>
      <p>There are five errors of the form:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;XPST0008: XSLT Pattern syntax error at char 31 on line 260 in {...lement(p:abc)/p:h...}:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no declaration for element &lt;p:abc&gt; in an imported schema</p>
      <p>In all cases these turn out to be because the element declaration in the schema is
         local. But fortunately in each case the type of the element is global, so schema-element(p:abc)
         can be replaced by element(p:abc,p:abcType).</p>
      <p>The stylesheet now compiles with no errors, but with half a dozen warnings of the
         form "The complex type of element ABC does not allow a child element named PQR".</p>
      <p>Now things start to get interesting. Let's take the first of these. It's true enough:
         the schema doesn't allow such an element. It's mentioned only once in the stylesheet,
         in a match pattern. Perhaps this is dead code, and the rule was never fired? Or perhaps
         the child element has been renamed? So we go to the DTD: we're in luck, it tells us
         that element PQR has been deprecated. So it seems they dropped support for it when
         they wrote the XSD, which means we can remove this rule from the stylesheet. We know
         the element won't appear in an instance because we know the instances are valid against
         the schema (well, we hope they are...).</p>
      <p>The next warning turns out to be an error introduced when I added prefixes. Instead
         of changing a/fred to p:a/p:fred, I had changed it to p:a/p:red. Thanks, schema aware
         processor, you spotted my error.</p>
      <p>The next one is similar, but this time I had forgotten to add the prefix to one of
         the element names in a long path.</p>
      <p>And the fourth warning is the same kind of mistake as the second.</p>
      <p>The stylesheet now compiles without any errors or warnings (that was easier than I
         expected!). But it gives a runtime error: "When 'standalone' or 'doctype-system' is
         specified, the document must be well-formed; but this document contains a top-level
         text node". It took me about 20 seconds to work out what that really means: Silly
         me, I forgot to validate the source document, so it didn't match the root template
         which I had changed from match="/" to match="document-node(schema-element(p:abc))".
         Ran again with -val:strict on the command line. This time we get no errors or warnings,
         and it produces HTML output. However, a quick visual check reveals there are quite
         a few chunks of text missing from the output.</p>
      <p>A quick thought: I had left the stylesheet version as "1.0". Type checking is stricter
         in 2.0 mode, so I try switching it to 2.0 and running again. No difference. But it
         was worth a try.</p>
      <p>Let's see if I can identify the cause of one of the bits of missing HTML by hand,
         and then see if there's a general approach to solving the others. The first thing
         that's missing is a line that says "Processed by Jane Doe, 2007". Does Jane Doe appear
         in the (new format) source XML? No, she doesn't. Does she appear in the old format
         XML? Yes, she does.</p>
      <p>So, if there's information that's in the old XML but not in the new, then I'm not
         going to be able to produce the identical HTML, which puts a slight spanner in the
         works as regards how I was proposing to test it. Time to report back to the client.</p>
      <p>To be continued.</p>
      <p>
         
         <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">One way forward might be to run the old stylesheet against the old XML in Stylus Studio,
         and use back-mapping to identify which part of the stylesheet generated the HTML that's
         missing from the new output. I'll keep that plan in reserve. First I'm going to see
         what I can do with Saxon directly (because it's always best when possible to use the
         tools that sit most comfortably in your hands.) I'm going to try running both the
         (oldXML+oldXSLT) and the (newXML+newXSLT) in Saxon with trace output (-T), and see
         how the traces compare.</p>
      <p>(Shame that Saxon doesn't provide any way on the command line of sending -T output
         to a file.)</p>
      <p>Interesting: the old trace is 116,000 lines long, the new trace only 350!</p>
      <p>In both cases the output of literal result elements isn't being traced. I'm seeing
         the attributes, but not the elements. That would appear to be a bug in Saxon 9.2.
         I'll stack that for processing later.</p>
      <p>First discrepancy in the trace is where the stylesheet selects the path ead/frontmatter/titlepage/titleproper:
         this is selecting something in the old document, but the converted path selects nothing
         in the new. Looking at the new XML, the relevant text is now at ead/eadheader/filedesc/titlestmt/titleproper.
         So rather than just fixing the path, I need to ask why was this path accepted by the
         static analysis against the schema, which was supposed to spot such things? Looking
         at the schema, it seems that the frontmatter element is permitted by the schema, even
         though it's not used in our XML instances. It looks as if it's been left in there
         for backwards compability.</p>
      <p>This makes me feel that perhaps I should generate a new schema from the instances.
         I've asked the client for a larger collection of instances than I'm working with at
         the moment, so I'll defer that task until they arrive. Meanwhile, I'll just comment
         out the reference to frontmatter in the schema, and see what happens.</p>
      <p>I expected lots of warnings from stylesheet compilation but there were none. Ah! I'm
         loading the schema from the web, not from the local copy I edited. Now I get 7 warnings
         of the form</p>
      <p>Warning: on line 12 of abcdef.xsl:<br>&nbsp; The complex type of element ead does not allow a child element named frontmatter</p>
      <p>Good: I can now look at these six path expressions and work out where the data has
         moved to in the new document. (After doing this, I realise I could simply have looked
         for all occurrences of "frontmatter" in the stylesheet. Perhaps I was being too clever.
         But it took no longer, and was more rigorous.)</p>
      <p>Umm. The titleproper element is mixed content. In the old document we find</p>
      <p>&lt;titleproper encodinganalog="title"&gt;Guide to Bananas, &lt;date&gt;1942-2002&lt;/date&gt;&lt;/titleproper&gt;<br>&lt;num&gt;MS2144&lt;/num&gt;</p>
      <p>whereas the new document has</p>
      <p>&lt;titleproper&gt;Guide to Bananas, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"&gt;1942-2002&lt;/date&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;num&gt;MS2144&lt;/num&gt;<br>&lt;/titleproper&gt;</p>
      <p>That seems an odd change, the way &lt;num&gt; appears in the mixed content text without
         any punctuation. I don't really understand why it's been coded this way, but I'll
         just be pragmatic: change the value-of to an apply-templates, and have a template
         rule for titleproper/num that skips this content.</p>
      <p>One of the paths that has to be changed is tricky ("sponsor") because it doesn't match
         anything in the old instance document. But the DTD allows it, and there's a similar
         element in the new schema, so I'll take a risk here by changing the code even though
         I don't have any data to test it against.</p>
      <p>There's some trickiness because an element(did/head) appears in the old XML with a
         standard value ("Description"), but doesn't appear in the new XML. This would be easy
         enough to deal with, except that the element is being used (a) to generate an ID for
         use in the table of contents, and (b) its presence is triggering some conditional
         logic. So I'm forced to try and understand what is going on here... Ah: a wonderful
         bit of obfuscated logic: there's an apply-templates select="did/head", which itself
         does an apply-templates select="../*[@label]", so the whole section isn't processed
         if there's no head child. Moreover, the schema-aware stylesheet analysis has let me
         down here: it isn't clever enough to spot that "../*[@label]" will select nothing
         in the new schema, because the @label attribute has disappeared, being replaced by
         a more descriptive element name.</p>
      <p>(I'm running out of screen space. I've got two high-res screens in front of me, one
         with this blog plus old and new HTML, one with the text editor showing old and new
         XML and XSL. I need more.)</p>
      <p>I don't have an (old) instance document in which the element is absent, so I don't
         really understand what's supposed to happen in this case.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">I've now recast a section of the stylesheet by hand to cope with the structural changes
         in the source XML, and I've realised that I got very little help from the schema.
         The reason is that the schema is too permissive - it allows many parts of the "old"
         XML format that aren't actually being used any more. So, into Stylus Studio, to generate
         a new schema from the instance document. This one will only describe what's actually
         there. Then recompile the stylesheet with this new more restrictive schema.</p>
      <p>Bingo. We now have a screenful of errors and warnings. Unfortunately the errors are
         bogus: they relate to the patterns such as element(e:abc, e:abcType) that we introduced
         earlier. The schema generated by Stylus Studio, of course, has not used the same type
         names. In fact, it's made all the element declarations global, so we can go back to
         using schema-element(e:abc).</p>
      <p>Three errors remain, these relate to template rules that match elements which don't
         appear in the instance document. We'll comment these out for now.</p>
      <p>This leaves 25 warnings of the form "The complex type of XXX does not allow a child
         element named YYY" - and then it says "No more warnings will be displayed", because
         Saxon stops after 25. (No option to change that, sadly). So at last, we've got some
         concrete indication, without having to inspect the output by eye, of where the paths
         are that need changing.</p>
      <p>Some of them, oddly, are on "line 0". From experience, the only way to fix poor Saxon
         diagnostics is to do it immediately, while you've got the incorrect stylesheet to
         play with. So it's into the IntelliJ IDE to discover why it hasn't got a line number
         for these paths. It turns out this is a bug that has been there "for ever": the line
         number information isn't being set on the subsidiary patterns in a location path pattern,
         for example the pattern representing the a/b part of a/b/c. That's done, unwind the
         stack.</p>
      <p>Quite a lot of the incorrect paths are going via an element descgrp which serves merely
         to group a rather arbitrary collection of properties.</p>
      <p>(to be continued) </p>
      <p>
         
         <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">It's now largely a question of hard slog debugging. Despite best efforts, in the end
         you have to look at the HTML and try to understand why it's different.</p>
      <p>I made use of the -T tracing option in Saxon to good effect to see which template
         rules were firing. There should probably be an option that ONLY shows you which template
         rules are firing. I had to fix the 9.2 bug whereby insufficient trace was being output,
         and in the course of this I found another usability problem: when running within IntelliJ,
         you can't use the usual 2&gt; option to redirect standard error output, and there's no
         Saxon option to send the output to a file, so it wasn't possible to capture the output.
         Fixed that by overloading the -traceout option.</p>
      <p>
         
         <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>The output is now fairly close to what's required. I decide to change the default
         template rule to display unmatched elements in red, so I can make sure that all elements
         in the input XML are handled by explicit template rules. This reveals some elements
         that aren't being matched. I'm puzzled as to why, so I add a call on saxon:stack-trace()
         to show where the fallback template rule is being called from. Unfortunately it turns
         out saxon:stack-trace() isn't working properly in Saxon 9.2, so I fix it.</p>
      <p>That resolves the problem in the stylesheet: a simple error in a match pattern.</p>
      <p>
         
         <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">I've split some very large templates in the stylesheet into smaller units (using call-template)
         to make the code more readable and maintainable. I noticed that in doing this, we
         lose some static type-checking. There's no way in XSLT 2.0 to declare the expected
         context item type of a named template: I've added an enhancement suggestion to do
         this in 2.1. However, it might be possible in Saxon to extend the type checking from
         a call-template to the template that is invoked.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">From here on, it was largely a process of refinement. I had to abandon making the
         HTML 100% compatible with the previous version, for a number of reasons: one was that
         there was data that wasn't properly formatted in the old version, and reproducing
         the old bugs was going to be too difficult! I've handed over a stylesheet that does
         the job adequately on the test data currently available, but it's clear that as more
         documents are added to the test pool, further refinement will be needed. The stylesheet
         probably only handles about 50% of the elements that are permitted by the schema,
         and a big question is whether that will also be true of the final population of instance
         documents. If so, good software engineering would probably demand creation of a restricted
         schema that all the instance documents are expected to conform to, and testing that
         the stylesheet can handle all instances of that restricted schema.</p>
      <p>Even though this was simple XSLT 1.0 programming, it was a useful exercise. It flushed
         out several weaknesses in Saxon's diagnostics, proving how important it is that those
         who develop software products should also occasionally use them in anger to solve
         real problems. (All too often, especially in big companies, this never happens: I've
         known cases where the product developers wouldn't have the faintest idea where to
         start.) It also generated a number of ideas for new features that could aid this kind
         of task.</p>
      <p>Using the schema-awareness capabilities was useful, but not the whole answer. It's
         too much effort to take advantage of schema-awareness and achieve rigorous static
         type checking of path expressions, and even then, many paths such as ../@code aren't
         checked (only downwards paths are analyzed). Also, while the static checking gives
         assurance that the paths in the stylesheet are capable of selecting something, there's
         no analysis of how complete the coverage is. It would be nice to know at compile time,
         rather than at run-time, that an apply-templates can select elements for which there
         is no template rule.</p>
      <p>That's all for now. Sorry it was rather disjointed, but I thought it might be interesting
         to report progress as it happened, rather than giving a sanitised version later!</p>
      <p>One final point: I underestimated the size of the task quite considerably. I thought
         I could do it comfortably in about 15 hours but it's taken more like 30.</p>
