      <p>There was a support request from Francis Upton a couple of days ago asking for a switch
         to turn optimization off. He had a large query that was taking a long time to compile,
         and naturally felt that the cost could be reduced by omitting the optimization phase.
         It's a natural assumption to make, and I've always assumed myself that there were
         savings to be made in this area. But as always with performance, assumptions are dangerous
         until they have been verified by measurement.</p>
      <p>I asked for a copy of the query concerned; it turned out to be 9Mb of code, about
         70K lines in a single module. It's code that has been automatically generated to validate
         complex incoming EDI messages. It's not particularly representative of user-written
         code in that some of the functions are over 500 lines long, and I suspected this might
         have something to do with the problem. But since compile time performance in Saxon
         has received very little attention over the years, it was a welcome opportunity to
         do some investigation.</p>
      <p>Francis had attempted a patch to turn optimization off, but he got it wrong - he was
         only suppressing optimization for the query body, not for all the functions. An easy
         mistake to make. But when I tried it with optimization turned off "properly", total
         query compilation time (reported as "analysis time" using the -t option on the command
         line) only dropped from 57 to 55 seconds. So the assumption that optimization was
         the culprit was clearly flawed.</p>
      <p>The next step was to do some Java profiling (-Xrunhprof:cpu=samples) on the command
         line. As often happens, the result was initially disappointing: a lot of calls on
         a recursive method ExpressionTool.resetPropertiesWithinSubtree() and on Choose.iterateSubExpressions()
         but I was under the impression that these would both be used from many places during
         compilation, so the information didn't look too useful. The data from this tool tends
         to be very "bottom up" - it tells you what code is being executed, but it doesn't
         tell you when or why.</p>
      <p>So I started inserting some calls to System.nanoTime() into the source and getting
         a breakdown by phase of compilation. This quickly showed
         that of the 57 seconds, parsing took the first 3.6 seconds, optimization the final
         1.9 seconds, while over 50 seconds was spent in the XQueryFunction.compile() method,
         called once per function. Some further investigation showed that 48.2 seconds of this
         was in the typeCheck() phase.</p>
      <p>Not being able to see how to break this down any further, I went back to the Java
         profile data. The iterateSubExpressions() method is implemented for every kind of
         expression, to return its subexpressions
         on the expression tree. The implementation of this method for a Choose expression
         (used for if/then/else, xsl:choose, and also typeswitch) was particularly inefficient,
         so I rewrote it, and the total compile time came down to 40.8 seconds! A very easy
         gain (30%) in an area where I would never have expected to find one.</p>
      <p>That set me thinking about the other method to feature significantly in the profile:
         resetPropertiesWithinSubtree(). Saxon maintains properties of expressions on the expression
         tree: these include
         type information, information about dependencies (for example, whether an expression
         depends on the context item), and information about special properties of node-sets
         (such as whether it is known statically that the nodes will be in document order,
         or will come from a single document). These properties are calculated lazily, and
         they are typically reset (to null) if an optimizer rewrite is such that it's advisable
         to recompute the values. Usually this rewrite works upwards - properties for all the
         ancestor expressions are reset to null. But this method clears the properties for
         all the descendants in a subtree. It turns out there is only one place it is called:
         during analysis of a for/let/some/every expression, if extra information becomes available
         about the type of the variable, this information is passed to all places where references
         to the variable occur, and then properties are cleared for every expression within
         the scope of the variable, presumably on the theory that the extra type information
         now available might come in useful for refining these properties.</p>
      <p>So, just as an experiment, I commented out the single line of code that calls this
         method (in Assignation.refineTypeInformation(), line 433 of net.sf.saxon.expr.Assignation.java),
         and the total compilation time is now reduced from 57 seconds to 8.46 seconds!</p>
      <p>But is it safe? Well, I tried rerunning the W3C XQuery test suite (19000 tests) and
         it made no difference to the results. I did the same with the XSLT test suite, and
         with my personal test suites, and there was still no impact.</p>
      <p>But perhaps the call is important for performance reasons? I reran the XMark benchmark:
         no regressions. (There's a side-story there, in that there was a regression, but it
         turned out to not to be caused by this change. There were also some significant improvements
         from 9.1 figures, all caused by some optimization changes made a few days ago that
         I hadn't yet run XMark on.)</p>
      <p>So, I'm going to get rid of this method call, and cross my fingers. I won't do it
         as a 9.1 patch, I'll leave it till the next full release when it should get more exposure
         to testing. But it looks like a big improvement for rather little effort, and if you
         feel like trying the change locally, by all means do.</p>
