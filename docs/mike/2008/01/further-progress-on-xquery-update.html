      <p>I've no got to the point where my XQuery Update implementation is passing almost all
         the published tests. That doesn't mean its complete, because the test suite doesn't
         cover certain areas, such as revalidation of updated documents. But it's looking good.</p>
      <p>There were quite a few hassles getting corner cases to parse correctly. The XQuery
         grammar really is very fragile, and it's hard to make changes to a parser without
         breaking something. The particularly thorny point was the overloading of the "as"
         keyword in the insert and rename expressions, which has required changes to the Tokenizer
         that have side-effects on almost all other constructs using "as".</p>
      <p>The other problem has been making the linked tree fully updateable. There were all
         kinds of hidden assumptions here about node identity and document order that have
         had to be revisited. Some of them still need to be addressed, for example I don't
         yet have an efficient way of representing the base URI of nodes. Currently a lot of
         properties (like base URI and in-scope-namespaces) are computed on demand rather than
         being physically stored in each node, and this makes for extra work when updating.
         There are also document-level indexes that need to be updated or invalidated. I was
         lucky that the test suite caught one or two of these, because it's only doing tiny
         queries on updated documents so a lot of errors could remain uncaught.</p>
      <p>There's a nasty messiness in the spec concerning the rules for mixing updating and
         non-updating statements. For example, if one branch of a conditional is an updating
         expression, then the other must either be an updating expression, or (), or a call
         on error(). The problem with this is that you can only tell whether an expression
         is updating after you have bound function calls to the corresponding function declarations,
         and by that time Saxon has already done the first stages of simplification of the
         expression tree: for example it replaces a typeswitch expression by a corresponding
         structure of nested conditionals on-the-fly while parsing. If I can't get the rules
         changed in this area then it's going to be quite difficult to implement them precisely:
         it would mean, for example, that the expression tree has to retain information about
         otherwise redundant parentheses in the source query. Really this part of the language
         is badly designed; the rule on mixing updating and non-updating expressions should
         be phrased as a semantic rule not as a syntactic one. I'd be suprised if other implementors
         don't have similar problems, although some of them may be less agressive in the rewrites
         they attempt than Saxon is.</p>
