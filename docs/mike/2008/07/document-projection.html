      <p>Document Projection [1] is a technique invented by Amlie Marian and Jrme
         Simon designed to reduce the amount of memory occupied by a source document used by
         a query or transformation. The idea is to analyze the query and determine what nodes
         it is capable of accessing, and then while parsing and building the document, to filter
         out all those nodes that the query can never access. I decided to have a go at implementing
         this in Saxon.</p>
      <p>In fact, the exercise started with a different purpose. The Orbeon XForms engine makes
         use of Saxon for evaluating XPath expressions, and when the user changes any field,
         all the path expressions have to be re-evaluated to check that field contents are
         still valid and to do all the other clever things that XForms engines do in response
         to user input. With a complex form this can get quite time-consuming, so I spent a
         couple of days working with Erik Bruchez of Orbeon (encouraged and funded by a mutual
         customer) to see if we could find a way of statically analyzing the XPath expressions
         to see which changes to the form could affect the results of which XPath expressions,
         and thus avoid reevaluating the expressions whose value could not be affected by the
         change. It turns out that the path analysis to do this is exactly the same as that
         needed for document projection (as I discovered after my first two attempts to devise
         a suitable algorithm on my own).</p>
      <p>As always with research papers, you find that the problem has been simplified. Marian
         and Simon do the analysis after the query has been reduced to a subset language they
         call "XQuery core", which eliminates many of the problems such as working out which
         nodes are atomized, how to handle backwards axes, and so on. Some of the assumptions
         are stated, some are left implicit. For example, a query might select a set of nodes
         in the source document. Document projection can be done in such a way that the same
         nodes are guaranteed to be selected, but if the user application is going to do any
         further processing of those nodes, then you have to make assumptions about what processing
         it will do. Very often the result of the query will be serialized, in which case you
         want to retain the complete subtree rooted at any selected node.</p>
      <p>Another assumption seems to be that the context node for the query will be a document
         root. And there are difficulties if the query calls the doc() function with arguments
         computed at run-time, because this means you don't know whether two different calls
         on doc() might select the same document, in which case you would have to form the
         union of the nodes reachable from each call.</p>
      <p>After a few false starts I found that it wasn't too hard to get the path analysis
         right, though at present I don't attempt to follow links through user-defined functions.
         There are still one or two glitches with non-downward axes, but it should be possible
         to sort them out. For example, given the query .//E[following-sibling::E], it's not
         good enough to just retain the E elements, because that leaves you no way to determine
         from the projected document which E elements are siblings of each other. The projection
         has to include the parent of the E elements as well. At present, I'm not doing any
         lookahead or backtracking, so when I encounter an element in the SAX event stream
         I don't know whether it is the parent of an E element or not. So I have to keep it,
         just in case. Although this makes document projection ineffective for this example,
         it seems that such cases are rather few and far between, so this seems to be an acceptable
         compromise.</p>
      <p>The second phase of processing, using the results of the path analysis to drive a
         SAX filter that actually projects out the unwanted nodes, turned out to be relatively
         straightforward - one of those bits of code that is quite short, but rather mind-blowing
         to work out how it works. I started writing the code as my Eurostar train pulled out
         of London Waterloo station and it was working by the time we reached Brussels.</p>
      <p>How effective is document projection in real life? For queries like the ones in the
         XMark benchmark, it works superbly well - many of the documents reduce to 5% or less
         of their original size, making it feasible for the first time to run Saxon against
         the 1Gb version of this benchmark. It remains to be seen, however, how typical this
         benchmark is of real life. Certainly for document and message transformations, where
         most of the input data finds its way through to the output, projection by definition
         won't be much help.</p>
      <p>So far I've only attempted the path analysis for XQuery and not for XSLT. Static analysis
         of XSLT stylesheets is notoriously difficult because you often can't decide at compile
         time which templates will be invoked by which apply-template calls. (And even if you
         could, that would only reduce it to the same problem as function calls, which I'm
         not tackling yet in XQuery.) Nevertheless, I think it may be possible to do something
         useful for special cases such as a single-template stylesheet, and this will still
         be useful if one can explain to users how to write their code to take advantage of
         the facility.</p>
