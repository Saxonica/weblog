      <p>I spent a couple of days last week at the annual members meeting of the TEI (Text
         Encoding Initiative). It was good to meet so many Saxon users: a few familiar faces,
         rather more familiar names, and quite a few who introduced themselves as avid fans
         of the product, the book, or both.</p>
      <p>This wasn't a technology conference: the speakers didn't spend their time talking
         about the merits of different XML schema or transformation languages. They talked
         about the problem they were trying to solve: which in most cases involves the digital
         capture, with as much fidelity as possible, of ancient (or in a few cases not-so-ancient)
         texts. Very refreshing to spend a couple of days in the company of classicists, archaeologists,
         musicologists, literary scholars, librarians and archivists for whom the technology
         is just a tool.</p>
      <p>In fact the toolset in this community seems to be pretty uniform: XSLT (very often
         Saxon), Relax NG, and oXygen. They were all very pleased by the announcement that
         oXygen now comes with Saxon-SA support built in, and I had&nbsp; quite a few questions
         about whether I could see Saxon supporting Relax NG. (Good question, I don't know
         the answer. Although it's true that you can't do the type assignment with Relax NG,
         I would think that in principle, a lot of the compile-time checking that Saxon-SA
         does could equally well be done against a Relax NG schema.) One technology that is
         conspicuously absent is XQuery - I had a couple of rather bemused users asking why
         anyone would want to use it, when XSLT was so much more powerful?</p>
      <p>The projects described involved the digitisation of everything from monumental inscriptions
         in the classical world (one of the many new words I learnt was "epigraphy"), through
         a 10th century palimpsest containing the earliest known manuscript of Archimedes,
         through the complete correspondence of the German composer Carl Maria von Weber, all
         the way to 1930s comic books. In all cases the challenge is to capture the detail
         - for example the fact that several words in an inscription might now be illegible,
         but were recorded in the 18th century by the first antiquarian visitors to a site.
         Capturing different features of the text often leads to a need for parallel markup,
         with corresponding XSLT challenges - but as I say, we didn't get much technical detail.
         </p>
      <p>Did you know that someone has built an XML database containing 250,000 personal names
         of people mentioned in the records of classical Greece? All geographically coded with
         links to Google Earth (though I dare say the satellite imagery is a bit "out of date").</p>
      <p>One thing that did rather surprise me was that there is an immense of amount of investment
         going into the capture of all this data, but no-one seems to have much idea how it
         is going to be used. It's obvious to everyone that it's an immensely valuable resource,
         but there didn't seem to be many reports of projects that are using it rather than
         creating it.</p>
      <p>Little chance of any Saxon-SA sales among this crowd, sadly. They might have some
         well-funded projects but most of them are quite happy with what they can achieve using
         open source software.</p>
