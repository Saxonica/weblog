      <p>In a suggestion to the XML Schema Working Group[1], Axel Dahmen suggested defining
         a facet that allows the introduction of new lexical forms for existing data types.
         This would allow you, for example, to write a decimal value as "1,23", or a date as
         "12DEC2008", or a boolean as "yes". The Schema WG has already put out two "last call"
         drafts of the XSD 1.1 spec [2], so it's not really welcoming ideas for new features
         at the moment, but I thought I would take a look at this one independently.</p>
      <p>It so happens that the XSD 1.1 draft has introduced the possibility of vendor-defined
         primitive types, and also vendor-defined facets for restricting types. This was done
         partly as a way of deflecting pressure to add new primitive or built-in types to the
         core specification: it means that vendors who badly want a new type can be allowed
         to add it to their own product, and the WG can then incorporate it into the base specification
         if it proves popular with users. (The addition of precisionDecimal to the spec has
         been pretty controversial, and vendor extensibility was thought to be a way of easing
         such conflicts in future.)</p>
      <p>So I thought I would see what could be done to implement Dahmen's idea as a vendor-defined
         facet in Saxon. And it seems to work quite nicely. I've done it with XPath expressions
         rather than regular expressions as Dahment proposed. Here's an example:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;xs:simpleType name="euroDecimal"&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;xs:restriction base="xs:decimal"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;saxon:preprocess action="translate($value, ',', '.')"/&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
&lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>Here the action attribute of the new facet describes a conversion of the string as
         written from the lexical space of the restricted type to the lexical space of the
         base type, in the form of an XPath expression. The new facet, like xs:whiteSpace,
         is a "pre-lexical" facet rather than a constraining facet. The specification recognizes
         that there might be other pre-lexical facets other than whiteSpace, partly because
         the WG was planning to add one to do Unicode normalization. As it happens, the Saxon
         extension can do this easily: action="normalize-unicode($value, 'NFC')". It can also
         be used to normalize case or for many other similar operations.</p>
      <p>As far as schema validation is concerned, it's already easy enough to define a type
         that allows decimal numbers in the form "1,20", or dates in the form "12DEC1980",
         by using the pattern facet. The difference is that when you do this with the pattern
         facet, the value is still an xs:string, not an xs:decimal or xs:date. With the saxon:preprocess
         facet, the value will be typed as an xs:decimal or xs:date, which means it can be
         manipulated as such in schema-aware queries and stylesheets.<br></p>
      <p>In the above examples, the derived type expands the lexical space of the base type
         but it still accepts all the lexical forms that the base type accepts. Of course,
         this won't always be the case. If the euroDecimal example had been specified with
         action="translate($value, '.,', ',.')", then values containing a "." as the decimal
         point would no longer be accepted. In
         this case there seems to be a need to define a reverse transformation as well. This
         isn't needed for schema processing, but it is needed when typed values are serialized
         as strings during schema-aware XSLT and XQuery processing. It seems possible to provide
         this by another attribute:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;saxon:preprocess action="translate($value, '.,', ',.')"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reverse="</code><code>translate($value, '.,', ',.')"/&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>There are a few details I still have to work out, such as how this facet should apply
         to list and union types. But on the whole it seems a very simple and powerful mechanism.
         Of course, like all extensions, it suffers from the problem that many users will steer
         clear of it because it sacrifices portability. But there are new features in XSD 1.1,
         rather like the xsl:use-when mechanism in XSLT 2.0, that can help with that. So it
         seems a good candidate for
         the next Saxon release.</p>
