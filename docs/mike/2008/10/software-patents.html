      <p>The FFII (Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII)) is lobbying again
         in the fight against software patents: there's a draft petition being created at <a href="http://stopsoftwarepatents.eu/draft">http://stopsoftwarepatents.eu/draft</a> to which I have added my comments. They won the last round in 2005, succeeding in
         blocking EU legislation to permit software patents, but it seems to have made no difference
         on the ground, as the European Patent Office continues to grant them at a rate of
         knots. Presumably the EPO is happy to take the fees and leave the courts to sort out
         whether the patents are actually valid or not.</p>
      <p>I have absolutely no doubt that software patents are unquestionably a bad thing. It
         simply isn't in the public interest to grant them. The only possible reason for doing
         so is to reward and encourage innovation, and there is no evidence that they have
         that effect, and plenty of evidence that they do exactly the opposite. At the same
         time they endanger the livelihoods of many independent software developers like myself,
         because any time one of the big boys starts to feel that they've got a flea on their
         back, they can threaten litigation and the flea is effectively out of business: a
         small company can't afford to pay royalties, and can't afford to challenge a patent
         in the courts.</p>
      <p>In any other area, of course, you can stay out of trouble by not breaking the law.
         But with patent infringement, there is no practical strategy for writing software
         that avoids violating patents - there are zillions of them out there, and even though
         they are searchable, the search will only succeed if by some coincidence the patent
         holder used the same terminology to describe the idea as you are using. It's not surprising
         I can't get insurance against patent infringement - the insurance companies know when
         they're taking on an impossible risk. I fork out dutifully for professional liability
         insurance which covers me for all sorts of things I would never dream of doing, like
         giving bad advice, and doesn't cover me against something that is entirely outside
         my control.</p>
      <p>So in practice I just take the risk. I wrote a stylesheet yesterday that takes an
         XML tree as input and produces an SVG rendition of the tree as output. Has anyone
         done it before? Probably, but I had a look around and couldn't find anything suitable.
         Is it "obvious to one skilled in the art"? Who knows, it depends how skilled you mean.
         Has anyone patented it? Well, I could spend a day writing it, or a week searching
         patents. </p>
      <p>It's interesting to see how dominated the US software industry is nowadays by lawyers.
         I have colleagues on standards groups who can't click "I agree" on the terms and conditions
         for the hotel's internet service without consulting their company lawyers first. At
         a more serious level, I regularly get questions from prospective users of the open-source
         version of Saxon about the fine print of the licensing conditions. One potential redistributor
         went through every line of the source code identifying names of contributors to the
         code (who in some cases only wrote half a dozen lines) because they wanted evidence
         that the author and their employers had signed in blood to release the code. In the
         end I just have to tell people to take it or leave it: it's free, if you don't like
         it, you don't have to use it. A lot of this goes back of course to the SCO fiasco
         where fragments of UNIX code had passed through so many hands that tracing their origin
         and preventing them getting into bits of software with the wrong licensing conditions
         was virtually impossible. That's a copyright issue, of course, rather than a patent
         one, but it's part of the same malaise. On copyright, I have always been very careful
         only to do things that I'm allowed to do, but I have often been careless in protecting
         my backside by retaining detailed records.</p>
      <p>There's an <a href="http://www.digitalmajority.org/forum/t-21772/will-the-patent-system-trigger-financial-collapse-in-2008">interesting article</a> written a year ago which I would have dismissed at the time as absurdly alarmist:
         it predicts financial meltdown in 2008 caused by bad assets in three areas: consumer
         credit, mortgages, and intellectual property. Well, the first two have hit us, I wonder
         if the third is real too? I wonder how much of the piling up of patent portfolios
         is driven by the effect on invisibles in the balance sheet? Until recently I had assumed
         that the real driver was the combination of managers wanting to avoid risks and lawyers
         making their living by discovering risks. But perhaps there's more to it than that.</p>
      <p>I'm sure that the long-term effect will be to move innovation to countries like India
         and China where the lawyers exert a less oppressive influence. It's paradoxical that
         in the West, where we pride ourselves on following free market principles, we should
         be so constrained by a patent system which goes against all those principles by granting
         monopolies on intellectual ideas.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I write software because it's a creative activity that I enjoy, and I will
         continue to do so until the lawyers stop me.</p>
