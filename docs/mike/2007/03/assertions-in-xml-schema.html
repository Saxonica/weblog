      <p>I've been implementing the new facility in XML Schema 1.1 for defining assertions,
         in terms of XPath expressions. It's a great feature. You could do something similar
         before, of course, using Schematron - but no-one really wants to do to separate validations
         using very different technologies. The new xs:assert clause makes it all much more
         seamless. As one might expect in a first draft though, there are glitches in the spec.</p>
      <p>The biggest glitch - not really a glitch in fact, more of a design disaster - is that
         they've timidly subsetted the XPath language, so you're working with a crippled language
         with a fraction of the expressive power that you want and need. That not only makes
         life tough for users, it also makes things much harder for implementors because you
         can't use an off-the-shelf XPath engine. Well, there's a handy Note in the spec that
         says you can implement a bigger subset if you like, so I've done the obvious thing
         and implemented the whole of XPath 2.0.</p>
      <p>With the full language, all kinds of possibilities open up. Basically, all the old
         problems disappear. It gives you cross-validation of elements and attributes:</p>
      <p>&lt;xs:assert test="@price gt @discount"/&gt;</p>
      <p>Alternative content models:</p>
      <p>&lt;xs:assert test="not(@sex='M' and exists('maidenName'))"/&gt;</p>
      <p>Cardinality constraints:</p>
      <p>&lt;xs:assert test="count(move) mod 2 = 0"/&gt;</p>
      <p>and a whole lot more. It's not just that it adds to the expressive power of the schema
         language, it also enables you to express many existing constraints in a simpler way.
         Someone on the xmlschema-dev list yesterday wanted to say that a value must be in
         the range 1-100, or 999. You can do that at present by defining a union between two
         types, one of which has minInclusive=1, maxExclusive=100, and the other has an enumeration
         restricting its value to 999. How mich simpler just to say</p>
      <p>&lt;xs:assert test=". = (1 to 100, 999)"/&gt;</p>
      <p>Another exciting possibility is that by allowing XPath expressions to use the doc()
         function, you can implement referential constraints across documents:</p>
      <p>&lt;xs:assert test=". = doc('lookup.xml')//code"/&gt;</p>
      <p>Finally, there's nothing to stop you calling out to Java extension functions:</p>
      <p>&lt;xs:assert test="checksum = my:checksum(.)"/&gt;</p>
      <p>So what have they got wrong?</p>
      <p>First, they've crippled XPath, as described above, for no discernible reason, reducing
         it to a pathetic subset. Many of the examples I've given aren't actually legal.</p>
      <p>Secondly, they've defined assertions only on complex types and not on simple types.
         [But this might be temporary, awaiting the reissue of XML Schema Part 2. There are
         hints in the Schema for Schemas that assertions on simple types will be allowed.]</p>
      <p>And then there are a few technicalities, like they've failed to define exactly what
         the static and dynamic context for XPath evaluation are. No doubt this will be fixed
         in future drafts.</p>
      <p>Implementing this in Saxon was pretty straightforward. I don't currently attempt to
         evaluate assertions in streaming mode: as soon as I hit an element with an assertion
         attached, I start building a TinyTree, and then I evaluate the assertions when I hit
         the endElement event. Assertions on nested elements can share the same tree - Saxon
         already has a "virtual copy" mechanism so I can run an expression on a subtree of
         the main tree without making a real copy. If someone wants to define assertions whose
         scope is the whole document, they can, but the price is that a tree gets built. If
         you only define assertions with a local scope (say a single "record") then trees only
         get built for one "record" at a time, and are discarded as soon as the endElement
         event occurs.</p>
      <p>Of course, for users the drawback is that few people will want to commit themselves
         to something that's currently only in one product and in a draft W3C spec. But someone
         has to be first, and it's a good way of exerting some pressure on the working group
         and on other vendors to speed things up a little.</p>
