      <p>At XML Prague yesterday we got a
         spontaneous round of applause when we showed the animated Knight's
         tour application, reimplemented to use XSLT 3.0 maps and arrays,
         running in the browser using a new product called Saxon-JS.</p>
      <p>So, people will be asking, what exactly
         is Saxon-JS?</p>
      <p>Saxon-EE 9.7 introduces a new option
         -export which allows you to export a compiled stylesheet, in XML
         format, to a file: rather like producing a .so file from a C
         compiler, or a JAR file from a Java compiler. The compiled stylesheet
         isn't executable code, it's a decorated abstract syntax tree
         containing, in effect, the optimized stylesheet execution plan. There
         are two immediate benefits: loading a compiled stylesheet is much
         faster than loading the original source code, so if you are executing
         the same stylesheet repeatedly the cost of compilation is amortized;
         and in addition, it enables you to distribute XSLT code to your users
         with a degree of intellectual property protection analogous to that
         obtained from compiled code in other languages. (As with Java, it's
         not strong encryption - it wouldn't be too hard to write a fairly
         decent decompiler - but it's strong enough that most people won't
         attempt it.)</p>
      <p>Saxon-JS is an interpreted, written in
         pure Javascript, that takes these compiled stylesheet files and
         executes them in a Javascript environment - typically in the
         browser, or on Node.js. Most of our development and testing is
         actually being done using Nashorn, a Javascript engine bundled with
         Java 8, but that's not a serious target environment for Saxon-JS
         because if you've got Nashorn then you've got Java, and if you've got
         Java then you don't need Saxon-JS.</p>
      <p>Saxon-JS can also be seen as a rewrite
         of Saxon-CE. Saxon-CE was our first attempt at doing XSLT 2.0 in the
         browser. It was developed by producing a cut-down version of the Java
         product, and then cross-compiling this to Javascript using Google's
         GWT cross-compiler. The main drawbacks of Saxon-CE, at a technical
         level, were the size of the download (800Kb or so), and the
         dependency on GWT which made testing and debugging extremely
         difficult - for example, there was no way of testing our code
         outside a browser environment, which made running of automated test
         scripts very time-consuming and labour-intensive. There were also
         commercial factors: Saxon-CE was based on a fork of the Saxon 9.3
         Java code base and re-basing to a later Saxon version would have
         involved a great deal of work; and there was no revenue stream to
         fund this work, since we found a strong expectation in the market
         that this kind of product should be free. As a result we effectively
         allowed the product to become dormant.</p>
      <p>We'll have to see whether Saxon-JS can
         overcome these difficulties, but we think it has a better chance.
         Because it depends on Saxon-EE for the front-end (that is, there's a
         cost to developers but the run-time will be free) we're hoping that
         there'll be a reveue stream to finance support and ongoing
         development; and although the JS code is not just a fork but a
         complete rewrite of the run-time code the fact that it shares the
         same compiler front end means that it should be easier to keep in
         sync.</p>
      <p>Development has been incredibly rapid -
         we only started coding at the beginning of January, and we already
         have about 80% of the XSLT 2.0 tests running - partly because
         Javascript is a powerful language, but mainly because there's little
         new design involved. We know how an XSLT engine works, we only have
         to decide which refinements to leave out. We've also done client-side
         XSLT before so we can take the language extensions of Saxon-CE (how
         to invoke templates in response to mouse events, for example) the
         design of its Javascript APIs, and also some of its internal design
         (like the way event bubbling works) and reimplement these for
         Saxon-JS.</p>
      <p>One of the areas where we have to make
         design trade-offs is deciding how much standards conformance,
         performance, and error diagnostics to sacrifice in the interests of
         keeping the code small. There are some areas where achieving 100%
         conformance with the W3C specs will be extremely difficult, at least
         until JS6 is available everywhere: an example is support for Unicode
         in regular expressions. For performance, memory usage (and therefore
         expression pipelining) is important, but getting the last ounce of
         processor efficiency less so. An important factor (which we never got
         quite right for Saxon-CE) is asynchronous access to the server for
         the doc() and document() functions - I have ideas on how to do
         this, but it ain't easy.</p>
      <p>It will be a few weeks before the code
         is robust enough for an alpha release, but we hope to get this out as
         soon as possible. There will probably then be a fairly extended
         period of testing and polishing - experience suggests that when the
         code is 90% working, you're less than half way there.</p>
      <p>I haven't yet decided on the licensing
         model. Javascript by its nature has no technical protection, but that
         doesn't mean we have to give it an open source license (which would
         allow anyone to make changes, or to take parts of the code for reuse
         in other projects).</p>
      <p>All feedback is welcome: especially on
         opportunities for exploiting the technology in ways that we might not
         have thought of.</p>
