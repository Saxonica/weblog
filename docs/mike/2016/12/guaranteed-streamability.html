      <p>The XSLT 3.0 specification in its current form provides a set of rules (that can be
         evaluated statically, purely by inspecting the stylesheet) for determining whether
         the code is (or is not) guaranteed streamable.
         </p>
      <p>
         If the code is guaranteed streamable then every processor (if it claims to support
         streaming at all) must use streaming to evaluate the stylesheet; if it is not guaranteed
         streamable then the processor can choose whether to use streaming or not.
         </p>
      <p>
         The tricky bit is that there's a requirement in the spec that if the code isn't guaranteed
         streamable, then a streaming processor (on request) has to detect this and report
         it. The status section of the spec says that this requirement is "at risk", meaning
         it might be removed if it proves too difficult to implement. There are people on the
         working group who believe passionately that this requirement is really important for
         interoperability; there are others (including me) who fully understand why users would
         like to have this, but have been arguing that it is extremely difficult to deliver.
         </p>
      <p>
         In this article I'm going to try to explain why it's so difficult to achieve this
         requirement, and to explore possibilities for overcoming these difficulties.
         </p>
      <p>
         Streamability analysis can't be performed until various other stages of static analysis
         are complete. It generally requires that names have been resolved (for example, names
         of modes and names of streamable functions). It also relies on rudimentary type analysis
         (determining the static type of constructs). For Saxon, this means that streamability
         analysis is done after parsing, name fixup, type analysis, and rewrite optimization.
         </p>
      <p>
         When Saxon performs these various stages of analysis, it modifies the expression tree
         as it goes: not just to record the information obtained from the analysis, but to
         make use of the information at execution time. It goes without saying that in modifying
         the expression tree, it's not permitted to replace a streamable construct with a non-streamable
         one, and that isn't too hard to achieve (though these things are relative...). But
         the requirement to report departures from guaranteed streamability imposes a second
         requirement, which is proving much harder. If we are to report any deviations from
         guaranteed streamability, then up to the point where we do the streamability analysis,
         we must never replace a non-streamable construct with a streamable one.
         </p>
      <p>
         There are various points at which we currently replace a non-streamable construct
         with a streamable one.
         </p>
      <p>
         
         
         
         <ul>
            <li>Very early in the process, the expression tree that is output by the parsing phase
               uses the same data structure on the expression tree to represent equivalent constructs
               in the source. For example, the expression tree produced by &lt;xsl:if test="$a=2"&gt;&lt;xsl:sequence
               select="3"/&gt;&lt;/xsl:if&gt; will be identical to the expression tree produced by &lt;xsl:sequence
               select="if ($a=2) then 3 else ()"/&gt;. But streamability analysis makes a distinction
               between these two constructs. It's not a big distinction (in fact, the only thing
               it affects is exactly where you are allowed to call the accumulator-after() function)
               but it's big enough to count.</li>
            <li>At any stage in the process, if we spot a constant expression then we're likely to
               replace it with its value. For example if we see the expression $v+3, and $v is a
               global variable whose value is 5, we will replace the expression with the literal
               8. This won't usually affect streamability one way or the other. However, there are
               a few cases where it does. The most obvious is where we work out that an expression
               is void (meaning it always returns an empty sequence). For example, according to the
               spec, the expression (author[0], author[1]) is not streamable because it makes two
               downward selections. But Saxon spots that author[0] is void and rewrites the expression
               as (author[1]), which is streamable. Void expressions often imply some kind of user
               error, so we often output a warning when this happens, but just because we think the
               user has written nonsense doesn't absolve us from the conformance requirement to report
               on guaranteed streamability. Void expressions are particularly likely to be found
               with schema-aware analysis.</li>
            <li>Inlining of calls to user-defined functions will often make a non-streamable expression
               streamable.</li>
            <li>Many other rewrites performed by the optimizer have a similar effect, for example
               replacing (X|Y) by *[self::X|self::Y].</li>
         </ul>
         My first attempt to meet the requirement is therefore (a) to add information to the
         expression tree where it's needed to maintain a distinction that affects streamability,
         and (b) to try to avoid those rewrites that turn non-streamable expressions into streamable
         ones. As a first cut, skipping the optimization phase completely seems an easy way
         to achieve (b). But it turns out it's not sufficient, firstly because some rewrites
         are done during the type-checking phase, and secondly because it turns out that without
         an optimization pass, we actually end up finding that some expressions that should
         be streamable are not. The most common case for this is sorting into document order.
         Given the expression A/B, Saxon actually builds an expression in the form sort(A!B)
         relying on the sort operation to sort nodes into document order and eliminate duplicates.
         This relies on the subsequent optimization phase to eliminate the sort() operation
         when it can. If we skip the optimization phase, we are left with an unstreamable expression.
         
         </p>
      <p>
         The other issue is that the streamability rules rely on type inferencing rules that
         are much simpler than the rules Saxon uses. It's only in rare cases that this will
         make a difference, of course: in fact, it requires considerable ingenuity to come
         up with such cases. The most obvious case where types make a difference to streamability
         is with a construct like &lt;xsl:value-of select="$v"/&gt;: this is motionless if $v is
         a text or attribute node, but consuming if it is a document or element node. If a
         global variable with private visibility is initialized with select="@price", but has
         no "as" attribute, Saxon will infer a type of attribute(price) for the variable, but
         the rules in the spec will infer a type of item()*. So to get the same streamability
         answer as the spec gives, we need to downgrade the static type inferencing in Saxon.
         </p>
      <p>
         So I think the changes needed to replicate exactly the streamability rules of the
         XSLT 3.0 spec are fairly disruptive; moreover, implementing the changes by searching
         for all the cases that need to change is going to be very difficult to get right (and
         is very difficult to test unless there is another trustworthy implementation of the
         rules to test against).
         </p>
      <p>
         This brings us to Plan B. Plan B is to meet the requirement by writing a completely
         free-standing tool for streamability analysis that's completely separate from the
         current static analysis code. One way to do this would be to build on the tool written
         by John Lumley and demonstrated at Balisage a couple of years ago. Unfortunately that's
         incomplete and out of date, so it would be a significant effort to finish it. Meeting
         the requirement in the spec is different here from doing something useful for users:
         what the spec demands is a yes/no answer as to whether the code is streamable; what
         users want to know is why, and what they need to change to make the code streamable.
         The challenge is to do this without users having to understand the difficult abstractions
         in the spec (posture, sweep, and the rest). John's tool produces an annotated expression
         tree revealing all the properties: that's great for a user who understands the methodology
         but probably rather bewildering to the typical end user. Doing the minimum for conformance,
         a tool that just says yes or no without saying why, involves a lot of work to get
         a "tick in the box" with a piece of software that no-one will ever use, but would
         be a lot easier to produce. Conformance has always been a very high priority for Saxonica,
         but I can't see anyone being happy with this particular solution.
         </p>
      <p>
         So, assuming the WG maintains its insistence of having this feature (and it seems
         to me likely that it will), what should we do about it?
         </p>
      <p>
         One option is simply to declare a non-conformance. Once upon a time, standards conformance
         was very important to Saxon's reputation in the market, but I doubt that this particular
         non-conformance would affect our sales.
         </p>
      <p>
         Another option is to declare conformance, do our best to achieve it using the current
         analysis technology, and simply log bugs if anyone reports use cases where we get
         the answer wrong. That seems sloppy and dishonest, and could leave us with a continuing
         stream of bugs to be fixed or ignored.
         </p>
      <p>
         Another option is the "minimal Plan B" analyser - a separate tool for streamability
         analysis, that simply reports a yes/no answer (without explanation). It would be significant
         piece of work to create this and test it, and it's unclear that anyone would use it,
         but it's probably the cheapest way of getting the conformance tick-in-the-box.
         </p>
      <p>
         A final option is to go for a "fully featured" but free-standing streamability analysis
         tool, one which aims to not only answer the conformance question about guaranteed
         streamability, but also to provide genuinely useful feedback and advice helping users
         to create streamable stylesheets. Of course ideally such a tool would be integrated
         into an IDE rather than being free-standing. I've always argued that there's only
         a need for one such tool: it's not something that every XSLT 3.0 processor needs to
         provide. Doing this well would be a large project and involves different skills from
         those we currently have available.
         </p>
      <p>
         In the short term, I think the only honest and affordable approach would be the first
         option: declare a non-conformance. Unfortunately that could threaten the viability
         of the spec, because we can only get a spec to Recommendation status if all features
         have been shown to be implementable.
         </p>
      <p>
         No easy answers.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>LATER</b></p>
      <p>
         I've been thinking about a Plan C which might fly...
         </p>
      <p>
         The idea here is to try and do the streamability analysis using the current expression
         tree structure and the current streamability logic, but applying the streamability
         rules to an expression tree that faithfully represents the stylesheet as parsed, with
         no modifications from type checking or optimization.
         </p>
      <p>
         To do this, we need to:
         </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Define a configuration flag --strictStreamability which invokes the following logic.</li>
         <li>Fix places where the initial expression tree loses information that's needed for
            streamability analysis. The two that come to mind are (a) losing the information that
            something is an instruction rather than an expression (e.g. we lose the distinction
            between xsl:map-entry and a singleton map expression) - this distinction is needed
            to assess calls on accumulator-after(); (b) turning path expressions A/B into docSort(A!B).
            There may be other cases that we will discover along the road (or fail to discover,
            since we may not have a complete set of test cases...)</li>
         <li>Write a new type checker that attaches type information to this tree according to
            the rules in the XSLT 3.0 spec. This will be much simpler than the existing type checker,
            partly because the rules are much simpler, but more particularly because the only
            thing it will do is to assign static types: it will never report any type errors,
            and it will never inject any code to do run-time type checking or conversion.</li>
         <li>Immediately after this type-checking phase, run the existing streamability rules
            against the expression tree. As far as I'm aware, the streamability rules in Saxon
            are equivalent to the W3C rules (at any rate, most of the original differences have
            now been eliminated).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         There are then two options. We could stop here: if the user sets the --strictStreamability
         flag, they get the report on streamability, but they don't get an executable that
         can actually be run. The alternative would be, if the streamability analysis succeeds,
         attempt to convert the expression tree into a form that we can actually use, by running
         the existing simplify / typecheck / optimize phases. The distinctions introduced to
         the expression tree by the changes described above would be eliminated by the simplify()
         phase, and we would then proceed along the current lines, probably including a rerun
         of the streamability analysis against the optimised expression tree (because the posture+sweep
         annotations are occasionally needed at run-time).
         </p>
      <p>
         I will do some further exploration to see whether this all looks feasible. It will
         be very hard to prove that we've got it 100% right. But in a sense that doesn't matter,
         so long as the design is sound and we're passing known tests then we can report honestly
         that to the best of our knowledge the requirement is satisfied, which is not the case
         with the current approach.
