      <p>Saxon 9.2 introduced a limited capability to do "push processing" (using template
         rules) in streaming mode, that is, while parsing the source document, without ever
         building a tree representation of the source document in memory. This (added to the
         other streaming capabilities in Saxon) provides a useful capability for people who
         have to handle very large documents, but it only supports a small subset of the language,
         and achieving anything useful can sometimes require rather contorted programming.
         I've been revisiting the facility with the aim of supporting a much larger subset
         of the XSLT language in streaming mode, hopefully more like 80% rather than 20%, and
         thus making the streaming facilities far more accessible to the average developer.</p>
      <p>Details of the current facility (in Saxon 9.2) are at <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/serial/templates.html">http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/serial/templates.html</a>. Note how the documentation lists the small number of things that you are allowed
         to do, rather than the large number of things that you aren't. One of the aims is
         to reverse this, so the documentation only describes the list of things that aren't
         supported in streaming mode. Hopefully this list will be as simple as possible, and
         reflect user expectations: it's easy enough to tell people that you can't use the
         <strong>following-sibling</strong> axis, or <strong>last()</strong>, or <strong>xsl:number</strong>, and people will understand why; but having a rule that <strong>//a</strong> is allowed but <strong>//a/b</strong> isn't is just too hard for people to work with.</p>
      <p>Making this work has involved some fairly fundamental refactoring of the implementation.
         Saxon has for some time supported streaming of simple path expressions in push mode.
         This was originally introduced to support the XPath expressions allowed in XML Schema
         identity (uniqueness and referential) constraints, which allow only very simple downward
         paths; Saxon supports a slightly larger XPath subset than this in streaming mode,
         but it is still very restrictive. However, the basic architecture to implement this
         is quite powerful. When doing XSD validation, many uniqueness constraints can be in
         force at the same time (that is, within the same region of a source document), and
         Saxon's streaming engine therefore has the capability to distribute parsing events
         to an arbitrary number of recipients. The component that distributes the events is
         called the WatchManager, and each recipient is called a Watch. Watches may be added
         or removed dynamically during the course of parsing, and are notified when events
         occur that they have expressed an interest in.</p>
      <p>(Note that this kind of approach is really only possible with a push architecture,
         where the XML parser notifies events to the application. While one can envisage both
         schema validation and streamed XPath evaluation working on a pull implementation,
         it's very hard to see how a pull system could organize itself so multiple clients
         are reading the same data stream in parallel.)</p>
      <p>The WatchManager engine was used to support Saxon's initial foray into streamed XSLT
         processing, the "streaming copy" where every element selected by a path expression
         is copied to a mini-tree, and the mini-trees are then processed, one at a time, by
         the rest of the stylesheet code. In Saxon 9.2 this capability is packaged in the form
         of the <strong>saxon:stream()</strong> extension function, and is available in both XSLT and XQuery. (Details at <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/serial/saxonstream.html">http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/serial/saxonstream.html</a>).</p>
      <p>The implementation of streaming templates in 9.2, however, doesn't use the WatchManager.
         Instead, events from the SAX parser are passed to a StreamingDespatcher which keeps
         track of which template rules are active. The template rule itself is inverted (compiled
         into a co-routine, in the sense of Jackson Structured Programming): that is, the compiled
         code does not issue a subroutine call in response to an apply-template instruction
         (or other instructions that recurse down the tree, like xsl:copy-of and xsl:value-of);
         instead, it saves its state on an application stack, and yields control to its caller
         (the StreamingDespatcher), being called again to finish its work when the SAX parser
         notifies the matching end tag.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">I've made two significant changes to this architecture this week. Firstly, I've combined
         the functionality of the Selection objects (representing the streamable XPath expressions
         defined originally in the XSD specification) with the Pattern objects used to represent
         XSLT patterns. There were many similarities, and although there are also significant
         differences, it seemed that there were many benefits in combining the implementations:
         less code to maintain, enhancements apply to both cases, and only one set of rules
         for users to learn. One difference in functionality is that in streaming, the expression
         <strong>heading </strong>will select only <strong>&lt;heading&gt;</strong> elements that are children of the context node, whereas with XSLT pattern matching
         the pattern heading will select a <strong>&lt;heading&gt;</strong> element anywhere in the tree. So there are two modes of operation, anchored and unanchored:
         but this turns out to be a relatively minor difference. Another (larger) difference
         is that the predicates in an XSLT pattern are unrestricted, whereas in streamed paths
         they will be constrained, for example the predicate <strong>[following-sibling::x]</strong> will not be allowed.</p>
      <p>The second change to the architecture is that streaming templates will use the WatchManager
         to do the despatching, rather than having a separate StreamingDespatcher. It turns
         out that the WatchManager engine is quite powerful enough to do the job. Essentially,
         for each kind of construct that can appear in a streamed template and that can be
         invoked to process the subtree of a node (including <strong>apply-templates</strong>, <strong>xsl:copy-of</strong>, <strong>xsl:value-of</strong>, operations that get the string value or the typed value of the node, and aggregate
         functions such as <strong>count()</strong> and <strong>exists()</strong>), there is a special kind of Watch defined: the Watch defines which nodes it is interested
         in, and what it does with them, and the WatchManager only needs to know which Watches
         are active at any given time, and to pass them the relevant parsing events.</p>
      <p>One of the great advantages of this approach is that the facilities are much more
         uniform. In particular, the expressions you can write within <strong>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="X"/&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;xsl:copy-of select="X"/&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;xsl:value-of select="X"/&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;xsl:sequence select="count(X)"/&gt;</strong> are exactly the same, and are essentially the same as the rules for XSLT patterns,
         with some restrictions on what can appear in the predicates. A glance at the Saxon
         9.2 facility shows how much of an improvement this is.</p>
      <p>I've also introduced some machinery to allow the output of a watch to be processed
         through a push pipeline (known as a "feed"). Currently a function such as sum() or
         average() gets its data using a pull pipeline, a sequence of iterators each of which
         does some processing on the items delivered by the next iterator in the chain. For
         example, the nodes returned by an axis iterator are first atomized, then untyped values
         are converted to numbers, then the sequence is typechecked, before finally adding
         each number to a running total. Within a streamed template, this is reversed: each
         of these operations is invoked in push mode as the next item of data becomes available.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">A consequence of allowing patterns as streamable paths is that it becomes legal to
         evaluate something like &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="//section". The difficulty with
         this kind of expression comes when sections are nested: while processing sections
         that are nested three levels deep, parsing events must be sent to three different
         activations of the corresponding template rule, and the outputs of these template
         rules must be delivered in the correct order to the result document. Arguably this
         is not pure streaming, because it involves some buffering (of results, not of the
         source), but the fact is that it is very convenient to users to allow such constructs.
         It's not possible to disallow an expression that selects nested nodes (like <strong>//section</strong>) without disallowing many useful expressions that don't (like <strong>//employee</strong>), and it makes sense here for the implementation to take the strain in the interests
         of usability. As it turns out, there is no overhead caused by the result-buffering
         code in the case where the node sequence turns out to contain no nesting, as in the
         <strong>//employee</strong> example.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">There's still a lot of work to do to round this off and get it to production quality
         - most particularly, on testing. However, the heavy refactoring of the last few days
         is done, in the sense that all tests that worked before are now working again. I'll
         report again on progress as the implementation proceeds.</p>
