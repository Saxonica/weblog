      <p>I've been thinking carefully about whether there's a way to reduce the number of people
         "freeloading" on the back of Saxon - that is, selling commercial software that relies
         heavily on Saxon functionality without contributing anything in return. One potential
         way of doing that is switch in some way to a dual licensing approach: make application
         vendors choose between paying for a commercial license, and using the product under
         the GPL (GNU public license), which prevents them from creating "derivative works"
         unless those works are also licensed under the GPL (that is, made available as open
         source products). This is essentially the way MySQL works, and it seems to work well
         for them.</p>
      <p>However, there seem to be two obstacles in this approach that are very hard to overcome.</p>
      <p>The first is that the language of the GPL is very vague, and as far as I can see,
         it doesn't do what it claims to do.</p>
      <p>It's often thought that GPL says that if program A links to program B, and program
         B is issued under the GPL, then the GPL also applies to program A. Well go and read
         it: that's not what it says. GPL (this applies to both v2 and v3) doesn't even use
         the word "linking". It speaks of a "derivative work under copyright law:
         that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it". If someone distributes
         an application containing calls to Saxon, and tells you to download Saxon from SourceForge,
         I don't see how anyone can claim that the application is a derivative work under copyright
         law. It would be like saying that I've created a derivative work to Harry Potter merely
         by encouraging you to get yourself a copy and read it.</p>
      <p>Now you'll find plenty of statements like "It has always been the FSF's position that
         dynamically linking
         applications to libraries creates a single work derived from both the
         library code and the application code." Well, that may be their position, but it's
         not what the license says. And how can it possibly be true? The dynamic linking is
         done by the user, not by the supplier. If someone writes an application that calls
         JAXP interfaces, does that make the application a derivative work of every XSLT processor
         that implements JAXP interfaces, even XSLT processors that haven't been written yet?
         The idea is absurd. </p>
      <p>The other major obstacle to using the GPL is more of an ethical point than a technical
         or legal one. The GPL license requires you to sign up to a world view which I simply
         don't share. The preamble says, for example "the GNU General Public
         License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
         software--to make sure the software is free for all its users." Well, sorry, that's
         the opposite of what I want to achieve. I think it is right in principle that those
         who get benefits from software should contribute to the cost of its creation. My only
         reason for even looking at the GPL is to achieve greater fairness in this regard:
         essentially, to encourage those who get commercial benefits from using the software
         to pay for a commercial license. </p>
      <p>The Free Software Foundation includes in its FAQ statements like "If you hope some
         day to look back on your career and feel that
         it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society, you
         need to make your software free." I disagree 100% with that: I have spent 25 years
         of my life producing commercial software and I think that software has contributed
         just as much to society as the free software I have produced. There are things I dislike
         greatly about the capitalist system, for example the incredible waste of resources
         that goes into the unproductive activities of advertising and marketing, but (unlike
         the FSF, it seems) I do not disagree with the principle that those who produce useful
         things should be rewarded for their work. And I really don't want to sign up to a
         license that asks me in its preamble to agree with a political and philosophical position
         which I don't hold.</p>
      <p>This leaves me with the problem I started with of course: is there anything I can
         do from a licensing point of view to achieve my objectives, having ruled out GPL.
         On the other hand, MySQL must be doing something right.</p>
