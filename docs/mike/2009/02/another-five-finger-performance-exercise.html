      <p>Most of the performance work I do is on XSLT 2.0 stylesheets, and as a result there's
         little to be achieved by comparing Saxon's performance with other products (it's well
         known to be streets ahead of other XSLT 2.0 processors). As a result, I've done rather
         little in the way of comparative benchmarking in the last couple of years. But Tatu
         Saloranta has started doing some work looking at the performance of XML parsers in
         an XSLT environment, and in that context he started running the old Datapower XSLTMark
         tests (no longer available, sadly) which are all 1.0 stylesheets, and the figures
         comparing Saxon and Xalan seemed to be worth investigating.</p>
      <p>Most of the tests show no problem, but one or two seem to be anomalous. So I took
         one of the stylesheets that seemed to be performing particularly badly, reverser.xsl,
         and applied it to othello.xml as source. Here are the results, which give food for
         thought:</p>
      <p>Saxon: 155ms<br>Xalan (interpreted): 145ms<br>Xalan (XSLTC, compiled): 58ms</p>
      <p>What the stylesheet is doing is reversing the order of the words in each text node.
         The essence is this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;xsl:template name="textflipper"&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;xsl:param name="instring" select='""'/&gt;
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;xsl:variable name="firstword" select='substring-before($instring," ")'/&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:when test="string-length($firstword) &gt; 0"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:call-template name="textflipper"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:with-param name="instring" select="substring($instring,string-length($firstword)+2)"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:text&gt; &lt;/xsl:text&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:value-of select="$firstword"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:value-of select="$instring"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="text()"&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;xsl:call-template name="textflipper"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:with-param name="instring" select="normalize-space(.)"/&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>First, a couple of experiments to see the impact of a few small changes to the code.
         Changing the output method to "text" gets it down to 136ms, changing it to "xml" (which
         is what it actually ends up using) down to 142ms. The Xalan speed shows no difference
         from those changes. So it seems Saxon is paying an unnecessarily high price in the
         case where the output method is decided dynamically rather than statically. That certainly
         suggests an opportunity for improvement, though I'll keep it on the TODO list for
         now.</p>
      <p>Changing the stylesheet to say version="2.0" actually makes the performance worse,
         increasing the execution time to 166ms. That's disappointing, but not too surprising;
         2.0 imposes additional runtime type checks, which are hard to eliminate statically
         unless the code actually declares the types of its variables and parameters. But again,
         this is something we need to look at.</p>
      <p>Where is the code actually spending its time? Java profiling shows a heavy use of
         java.lang.Math.floor(), called from DoubleValue.round(). This is the consequence of
         two things: (a) 1.0 arithmetic is defined to to be double-precision floating point,
         and (b) the substring() function is defined to take doubles rather than integers as
         its arguments (and to apply round() to them). In the version="2.0" case, it's already
         optimized to use integer arithmetic, but that's not happening for 1.0.</p>
      <p>Can we make round() more efficient for the case where the double is already "a whole
         number"? I spent some time poking around the IEEE formats and there's no obvious way.
         Recognizing small integers specially, the kind that often occur in calling substring(),
         might be possible. But it's only half the answer, because round() still returns a
         double, which has to be cast to an integer eventually anyway. Looking more closely,
         substring is calling DoubleValue.round(), which implements the XPath round() function
         by calling Java Math.round() to get a long, then converting the long back to a DoubleValue,
         which the substring() code then converts back to a long. So we can short-circuit this.
         </p>
      <p>Run-time down to 149ms. Every little helps. But it would be better to avoid double
         arithmetic entirely.</p>
      <p>So, change the 1.0-mode version of ArithmeticExpression so that if both arguments
         are statically integers and the operator is +, - or * then it does integer arithmetic
         and then converts the result to a double; and change substring() so that if the argument
         is a call on fn:number() applied to an integer, it removes the call on fn:number.
         That looks good in theory, and seems to be working, but for some reason the performance
         has regressed slightly: now running at 151ms. Java profiling and Saxon -explain output
         show that we've got rid of all the floating-point conversion, but it doesn't seem
         to have achieved much on the bottom line.</p>
      <p>The profile is now showing a lot of time spent in getStringLength(). This is more
         expensive than you might expect because it has to check whether the string contains
         surrogate pairs, which count as one character rather than two. This is only done the
         first time; once it's established that a string contains no surrogate pairs, the check
         isn't done again. This suggests that it would be useful, when we construct a substring
         of a string that contains no surrogate pairs, to flag the substring as having the
         same property; equally, concat() could propagate the property, as could various other
         things such as the routines that construct strings from numbers.</p>
      <p>Implemented this, propagating the "noSurrogates" property through all the string manipulations
         done in this stylesheet: run-time now down to 139ms. That's better.</p>
      <p>The Java profile is now showing a suprising frequency of calls on getProperty() from
         openDocument() in the XMLEmitter. I'm getting suspicious: perhaps when the XML output
         method is used, and text nodes are written before the first element start tag, openDocument()
         is being called (and the serialization properties read) each time a text node is written?</p>
      <p>My suspicions are right. Fixed that, and the run-time is down to 117ms. Not quite
         down to the XSLTC figure yet, but enough to decide that it's time for lunch.</p>
      <p>
         
         <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">After lunch: I looked at a few more cases that were showing up in the Java profile.
         Calculating the effective boolean value of a variable looked like a rather convoluted
         path, because it wasn't taking account of the known type of the variable. The call
         on substring-before() was taking a lot of time to decide that it was a simple case
         with no special collation requirements, so I added a short-circuit for the common
         case. With these and a couple of other small tweaks, it's down to 112ms.</p>
      <p>Escaping special characters in the serializer always shows up as a hotspot, but it's
         very hard to see what to do about it. We could try harder to avoid the cost when outtputting
         compile-time literals, but there aren't many of those around here - just the odd space.
         </p>
      <p>There are a few other inefficiencies showing up, but they don't look big. <br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">I would have expected that declaring the type of the template parameter as xs:string
         would improve performance by removing run-time checking, and the -explain output does
         appear to show fewer checks taking place. In fact, declaring the type makes it slower;
         it turns out that (not shown on the -explain output) the template is checking that
         the supplied parameter is of the correct type. This doesn't happen for function calls,
         where the code for function calling generates the run-time checking code only where
         needed; but templates are treated differently because in general (that is, if they
         have a match attribute) it's not possible to tell statically who is calling whom.
         So it seems we only get this benefit if we rewrite the template as a function. But
         at the moment, the version written as a function is taking longer - 144ms. That, it
         seems, is because the function is being evaluated in pull mode: where all that a function
         does is to generate text that is written to the result tree, push mode is generally
         better. Really it's high time we unified named templates and functions, trying to
         get the best of both worlds for both cases.</p>
      <p>It turns out that my rewrite using functions isn't 100% equivalent to the original:
         the function is generating strings rather than text nodes, which means extra spaces
         are being inserted as separators, which might account for the extra cost.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Stripping whitespace from the source document improves the time to 95ms. Is there
         any way that could be automated? It's not so far-fetched as it might seem - this is
         just a special case of what we can do with document projection in XQuery. In principle,
         a stylesheet like this with only one template rule (for text nodes) is fully analyzable
         statically just as XQuery is, and it should therefore be possible to produce a path
         map showing all the nodes visited, and remove those that make no contribution to the
         output during document building - as it happens, these include not only the whitespace
         text nodes, but <em>all</em> the elements!</p>
      <p>Which suggests the idea that for XSLT, a different approach to document projection
         might be possible: any element that isn't matched by any template rule in the stylesheet
         can be skipped (replaced by its contents) during the initial document loading.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if there are no template rules that match any elements then we could
         rewrite the defaulted template rule for the root as:</p>
      <p>
         
         <address style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">&lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;</address>
         
         
         <address style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">&nbsp; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="//text()"/&gt;</address>
         
         
         <address style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</address><br>but this doesn't give very much saving - it seems that navigating down through all
         the elements and applying the built-in rule for each one costs very little.</p>
      <p>
         
         <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">I have now added static type checking for named template parameters, in the same way
         as for function parameters. Adding a type declaration to the xsl:param now brings
         the execution cost down from 114ms to 106ms. This doesn't help with the code as originally
         written, of course, but it's a good message for users that adding type declarations
         not only gives you better diagnostics but also better performance. And we can now
         consider whether to create a required type for the parameter automatically, based
         on the required type of the context where the variable is first used - in this case
         as the first argument of substring-before().<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">With the type declaration on the parameter, it's still running more slowly in 2.0
         mode than in 1.0 mode -- 122ms versus 104ms. That's a surprisingly big difference.
         There's no dramatic difference in the Java profiles for the two cases. There is a
         small difference in the -explain output: for the initial template call from the match="text()"
         template, 1.0 mode is doing normalize-space(string(.)) where 2.0 mode does normalize-space(treat
         as string(convert untyped atomic to string(atomize(.)))). Can't see immediately why:
         clearly for a text node, applying the string() function here is perfect.</p>
      <p>I've changed the type checking code for UntypedAtomicConverter so it recognizes this
         pattern and replaces itself with a simple call on the string function. The 2.0 performance
         is now in line with 1.0 (106ms).<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">That's probably exhausted the opportunities from this particular test case for the
         time being. I'll now go back to Tatu's results for XSLTMark as a whole and see if
         there are any others that call for attention. Matching the XSLTC figure will be a
         bit of a challenge, but we've made up more than half the difference and there's still
         more potential, even without going all the way to bytecode compilation.</p>
