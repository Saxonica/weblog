      <p>I've been thinking for a while about some repackaging for Saxon, and I've now got
         to the point where I'm working out the fine detail and creating appropriate build
         files.</p>
      <p>The main idea is that instead of two products, Saxon-B and Saxon-SA, there will in
         future be three: Home Edition (HE), Professional Edition (PE), and Enterprise Edition
         (EE).</p>
      <p>At the top end, EE is just a rebranding of SA, to reflect the fact that the commercial
         Saxon product is now differentiated by a lot more than schema awareness. For example,
         many people are using it for the streaming capabilities. The -SA suffix causes confusion
         because people imagine that you have to use a schema to use Saxon-SA.</p>
      <p>The introduction of the Professional Edition (PE) is an attempt to tackle the problem
         that an awful lot of people are currently getting a free ride, using Saxon for mission-critical
         production work and contributing nothing in return. There's a lot to be said for open
         source and free software, but unless there is some way of getting revenue to fund
         investment from the people who get value from it, investment in the technology starts
         to suffer, as does support. The revenue from Saxon-SA users has cross-subsidised the
         whole operation quite successfully until now, but the product is getting ever bigger
         and more complex and it's not clear that the current business model scales to meet
         the growing requirements of the user community. So the aim is to produce a very low-cost
         (but not zero-cost) version of the product that will be attractive to the bulk of
         commercial users.</p>
      <p>Of course the main reason people are reluctant to spend money is that the free version
         is good enough to meet their needs, and this means we need to make HE a bit less attractive
         to this community than Saxon-B is currently (but without alienating the open source
         community who provide so much value, collectively, by creating public awareness).
         This is a delicate tightrope to walk. For some time now I've been making new features
         available only in Saxon-SA; increasingly "minor" features will show up first in PE.
         The main carrot that I'm hoping will tempt people to take PE, however, will be convenience.
         For example, some of the optional features of the product will be available to HE
         users only in the form of source code, whereas they will be fully packaged in Saxon-PE.
         I'm also thinking that bug fixes might be available to HE users only in source form,
         while PE and EE users will get them packaged as a maintenance release.</p>
      <p>Another benefit of the repackaging is that it "cleans up" the open source product.
         Because of the long history, there are components such as the SQL module where it
         is not always possible to trace all the contributors (and certainly, where there are
         no formal signed handovers from those contributors clearing the code for use). This
         has caused problems for some integrators wanting to integrate the source into their
         own offerings. Many of these contributions are in non-core modules which can be isolated
         so that those who care about these things get a "cleaner" source distribution, in
         terms of having known and traceable provenance. (Using this kind of code in a commercial
         product is far less of a problem, because Saxonica in effect indemnifies the end user.)</p>
      <p>There are lots of risks associated with this strategy - one of them being that users
         will simply stick with Saxon 9.1. Well, actually, that's not really a risk - it's
         not a problem to Saxonica if they do, and the fact that they can do so will deflect
         some of the inevitable grumbling. Over time, I think we should be able to get to the
         position where those who have a good reason for not spending any money can get most
         of what they need without doing so, but those who are deriving real commercial benefits
         from the software contribute something to its ongoing development, and if we can get
         to that position then I think everyone will be better off.</p>
