      <p>Users sometimes imagine that just by running an application under Saxon-SA instead
         of Saxon-B, they will automatically get a performance boost. Sadly, this isn't the
         case. Sometimes Saxon-SA's more powerful optimizer will give a dramatic benefit, sometimes
         it will give none at all. In fact, sometimes if you move a workload to Saxon-SA without
         change, you see a performance regression. This is caused by the fact that Saxon-B
         can assume all nodes are untyped, whereas Saxon-SA can't make this assumption.</p>
      <p>To see why it makes a difference, consider the code <code>item[@code='A1234']</code>. If the compiler knows that the element and attribute will both be untyped (that
         is, not schema-validated), then it knows that it can simply generate code to compare
         the string-value of the attribute with the literal 'A1234'. Equally, if there is a
         schema that declares the attribute to be a string, the same simple code can be generated.
         But if you run Saxon-SA without declaring any schema type information, the compiler
         doesn't know what it will find in the <code>@code</code> attribute: it might, for example, be typed as a list of strings (in which case it
         needs to compare each of those strings individually), or as a list of integers or
         dates, in which case it needs to be prepared to raise a type error at run-time.</p>
      <p>In an ideal world, the answer to this would be: use a schema, and declare the types
         of all your variables and function parameters and results, so that the compiler has
         as much information as possible. If you do this, Saxon-SA will almost invariably outperform
         Saxon-B on common tasks like evaluating predicates. The problem is, the world isn't
         ideal, and people want instant gratification. They want to just switch to the commercial
         version of the software and see a performance improvement with no effort on their
         part. Which is not really that unreasonable an expectation.</p>
      <p>In Saxon 9.1, the Configuration object has a setting <code>setAllNodesUntyped(true)</code>, which if called at run-time, causes the compiler to generate code in the same way
         as Saxon-B, that is, on the assumption that at run-time, there will be no schema validation,
         and all nodes will be untyped. When you run Saxon-SA from the command line this is
         called automatically if you don't select the -sa option. But that's not a very happy
         solution, because if you don't select the -sa option then you don't get SA's souped-up
         optimizer either. If you're calling from Java however, you can create a <code>SchemaAwareConfiguration</code> to get the benefits of the SA optimizer, and then call <code>setAllNodesUntyped(true)</code> to say that it should generate code to handle untyped input documents.</p>
      <p>In 9.2 I'm trying to change this so the default options are the ones that give the
         best performance. There's a factory method <code>Configuration.newConfiguration()</code> which gives you the best <code>Configuration </code>available (if you install Saxon-EE, the new name for Saxon-SA, it will give you an
         <code>EnterpriseConfiguration</code>, which is <code>SchemaAwareConfiguration</code> under a new name). The option to say that all nodes are untyped is no longer at the
         Configuration level, but at the level of an individual XSLT or XQuery compilation,
         and it is now the default. If your query or stylesheet imports a schema, the setting
         automatically changes; the only time you really need to be aware of the switch is
         for the unusual case where you don't import a schema, but still want to handle schema-validated
         input.</p>
      <p>On the whole this is working well, but there are still a few glitches to be ironed
         out. One of them is that the minimum conformance level for XQuery permits the use
         of "construction mode preserve", which causes element nodes to be annotated as <code>xs:anyType</code> rather than <code>xs:untyped</code>. Saxon is currently disallowing this option if the "all nodes untyped" switch is
         set, but it doesn't seem right to reject a conformant query under default configuration
         settings. Since in the absence of validation there is almost no operational difference
         between <code>xs:anyType</code> and <code>xs:untyped</code>, I probably need to find a way of allowing <code>xs:anyType</code> nodes to appear even when the all-nodes-untyped option is set.</p>
