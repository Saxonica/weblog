      <p>Most tree representations of XML, including the Saxon TinyTree and LinkedTree implementation,
         as well as DOM, represent namespace information by holding a set of namespace declarations
         and undeclarations on each element node.
         </p>
      <p>
         I'm considering a change to this representation (for the Saxon implementations) to
         do something that more closely reflects the way namespaces are actually defined in
         XDM: each element node has a set of in-scope namespaces (held in a NamespaceMap object)
         containing all the information about the namespaces that apply to that element.
         </p>
      <p>
         The obvious objection to this, and the reason I've never done it before, is that it
         looks at first sight to be very inefficient. But consider:
         </p>
      <p>
         (a) in the vast majority of documents, there are very few namespace declarations on
         any element other than the root
         </p>
      <p>
         (b) if there are no namespace declarations on an element, it can point to the same
         NamespaceMap object that its parent element points to; in most cases, all elements
         in the document will point to the same shared NamespaceMap.
         </p>
      <p>
         (c) having a NamespaceMap object immediately available on every element node means
         we never need to search up the ancestor axis to resolve namespace prefixes
         </p>
      <p>
         (d) there are still opportunities for implementations of NamespaceMap that use "deltas"
         if space-saving in pathological cases is considered necessary.
         </p>
      <p>
         Note that the NamespaceMap holds prefix=uri pairs, not namespace nodes. Namespace
         nodes have node identity and parentage, which is what makes them so expensive. prefix-uri
         pairs are just pairs of strings without such baggage, and they can be freely shared
         across element nodes.
         </p>
      <p>
         The current implementation I'm using for NamespaceMap is an immutable map implemented
         as a pair of String[] arrays, one for prefixes and one for uris. The prefix array
         is maintained in sorted order so we can use binary search to find a prefix. Insertion
         of a new prefix/uri mapping is O(n), but this doesn't matter because the number of
         bindings is usually less than ten, and it's a rare operation anyway that only happens
         during tree construction.
         </p>
      <p>
         Because the NamespaceMap is immutable, the system is quite easy to implement in a
         tree builder that gets notified of namespaces incrementally (for example by a SAX
         parser). The tree builder maintains a stack of NamespaceMap objects. On a startElement
         event it allocates to the element the same NamespaceMap object that the parent element
         is using; when a namespace declaration or undeclaration is encountered, this is replaced
         with a new NamespaceMap with the required modifications.
         </p>
      <p>
         The real motivation for the change is in implementing copy operations. In complex
         multi-phase transformations both deep and shallow element copy operations are very
         frequent, and copying of the namespace information is a significant cost. The XSLT
         and XQuery language semantics require that when an element is copied, all its in-scope
         namespaces are copied, and this requires searching the ancestor axis to find them
         (we try quite hard to optimize this away, but we're not always successful). If the
         in-scope namespaces are readily to hand in a simple immutable object, we save this
         effort and just pass the complete object down the pipeline.
         </p>
      <p>
         The builder for the tree to which the element is being copied now has to merge this
         set of namespaces with the existing namespaces inherited from ancestor elements on
         the receiving tree. It should now be clear why I chose the particular data structure
         for the NamespaceMap: merging two sets of namespace bindings reduces to merging two
         sorted arrays, which is quite an efficient operation. It's also easy to optimize for
         the common case where the in-scope namespaces of the element being copied are exactly
         the same as the in-scope namespaces of its parent element (typically we'll find that
         the same NamespaceMap object is in use), in which case the merge becomes a null operation.
         </p>
      <p>
         Of course, there are many details to work through (not least, how we fit this in with
         third-party tree models that continue to use declarations and undeclarations). But
         initial experiments are looking encouraging.
