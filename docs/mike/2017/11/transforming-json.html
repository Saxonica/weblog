      <p>In my [conference paper at XML Prague](https://www.saxonica.com/papers/xmlprague-2016mhk.pdf)
         in 2016 I examined a couple of use cases for transforming JSON structures using XSLT
         3.0. The overall conclusion was not particularly encouraging: the easiest way to achieve
         the desired results was to convert the JSON to XML, transform the XML, and then convert
         it back to JSON.
         </p>
      <p>
         Unfortunately this study came too late to get any new features into XSLT 3.0. However,
         I've been taking another look at the use cases to see whether we could design language
         extensions to handle them, and this is looking quite encouraging.
         </p>
      <p><b>Use case 1: bulk update</b></p>
      <p>We start with the JSON document</p>
      <pre>[ {
  "id": 3, "name": "A blue mouse", "price": 25.50,
  "dimensions": {"length": 3.1, "width": 1.0, "height": 1.0},
  "warehouseLocation": {"latitude": 54.4, "longitude": -32.7 }},
  {
  "id": 2, "name": "An ice sculpture", "price": 12.50,
  "tags": ["cold", "ice"],
  "dimensions": {"length": 7.0, "width": 12.0, "height": 9.5 },
  "warehouseLocation": {"latitude": -78.75, "longitude": 20.4 }
} ]</pre>
      <p>and the requirement: for all products having the tag "ice", increase the price by
         10%, leaving all other data unchanged.
         I've prototyped a new XSLT instruction that allows this to be done as follows:</p>
      <pre>&lt;saxon:deep-update
root="json-doc('input.json')
select=" ?*[?tags?* = 'ice']"
action="map:put(., 'price', ?price * 1.1)"/&gt;</pre>
      <p>How does this work?
         </p>
      <p>
         First the instruction evaluates the <code>root</code> expression, which in this case returns
         the map/array representation of the input JSON document. With this root item as context
         item, it then evaluates the <code>select</code> expression to obtain a sequence of contained
         maps or arrays to be updated: these can appear at any depth under the root item. With
         each of these selected maps or arrays as the context item, it then evaluates the action
         expression, and uses the returned value as a replacement for the selected map or array.
         This update then percolates back up to the root item, and the result of the instruction
         is a map or array that is the same as the original except for the replacement of the
         selected items.
         </p>
      <p>
         The magic here is in the way that the update is percolated back up to the root. Because
         maps and arrays are immutable and have no persistent identity, the only way to do
         this is to keep track of the maps and arrays selected en-route from the root item
         to the items selected for modification as we do the downward selection, and then modify
         these maps and arrays in reverse order on the way back up. Moreover we need to keep
         track of the cases where multiple updates are made to the same containing map or array.
         All this magic, however, is largely hidden from the user. The only thing the user
         needs to be aware of is that the select expression is constrained to use a limited
         set of constructs when making downward selections.
         </p>
      <p>
         The select expression <code>select="?*[?tags?* = 'ice']"</code>
         perhaps needs a little bit of
         explanation. The root of the JSON tree is an array of maps, and the initial <code>?*</code> turns
         this into a sequence of maps. We then want to filter this sequence of maps to include
         only those where the value of the "tags" field is an array containing the string "ice"
         as one of its members. The easiest way to test this predicate is to convert the value
         from an array of strings to a sequence of strings (so <code>?tags?*</code>) and then use the
         XPath existential "=" operator to compare with the string "ice".
         </p>
      <p>
         The action expression <code>map:put(., 'price', ?price * 1.1)</code> takes as input the selected
         map, and replaces it with a map in which the <code>price</code> entry is replaced with a new
         entry having the key "price" and the associated value computed as the old price multiplied
         by 1.1.
         </p>
      <p><b>Use case 2: Hierarchic Inversion</b></p>
      <p>The second use case in the XML Prague 2016 paper was a
         hierarchic inversion (aka grouping) problem. Specifically: we'll
         look at a structural transformation changing a JSON structure
         with information about the students enrolled for each course to
         its inverse, a structure with information about the courses for
         which each student is enrolled.
         </p>
      <p>
         Here is the input dataset:
         </p>
      <pre>[
  {
    "faculty": "humanities",
    "courses": [
      {
        "course": "English",
        "students": [
          {
            "first": "Mary",
            "last": "Smith",
            "email": "mary_smith@gmail.com"
          },
          {
            "first": "Ann",
            "last": "Jones",
            "email": "ann_jones@gmail.com"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "course": "History",
        "students": [
          {
            "first": "Ann",
            "last": "Jones",
            "email": "ann_jones@gmail.com"
          },
          {
            "first": "John",
            "last": "Taylor",
            "email": "john_taylor@gmail.com"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "faculty": "science",
    "courses": [
      {
        "course": "Physics",
        "students": [
          {
            "first": "Anil",
            "last": "Singh",
            "email": "anil_singh@gmail.com"
          },
          {
            "first": "Amisha",
            "last": "Patel",
            "email": "amisha_patel@gmail.com"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "course": "Chemistry",
        "students": [
          {
            "first": "John",
            "last": "Taylor",
            "email": "john_taylor@gmail.com"
          },
          {
            "first": "Anil",
            "last": "Singh",
            "email": "anil_singh@gmail.com"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]</pre>
      <p>The goal is to produce a list of students, sorted by last name then irst name, each
         containing a list of courses taken by that student, like this:
         </p>
      <pre>[
  { "email": "anil_singh@gmail.com",
    "courses": ["Physics", "Chemistry" ]},
  { "email": "john_taylor@gmail.com",
    "courses": ["History", "Chemistry" ]},
  ...
]</pre>
      <p>The classic way of handling this is in two phases: first reduce the hierarchic input
         to a flat sequence in which all the required information is contained at one level,
         and then apply grouping to this flat sequence.
         </p>
      <p>
         To achieve the flattening we introduce another new XSLT instruction:
         </p>
      <p>
         
         
         
         <pre>&lt;saxon:tabulate-maps
root="json-doc('input.json')"
select="?* ! map:find(., 'students)?*"/&gt;</pre>
         
         
         
         <p>Again the <code>root</code> expression delivers a representation of the JSON document as an array
            of maps. The <code>select</code> expression first selects these maps ("?*"), then for each one
            it calls map:find() to get an array of maps each representing a student. The result
            of the instruction is a sequence of maps corresponding to these student maps in the
            input, where each output map contains not only the fields present in the input (first,
            last, email), but also fields inherited from parents and ancestors (faculty, course).
            For good measure it also contains a field _keys containing an array of keys representing
            the path from root to leaf, but we don't actually use that in this example.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Once we have this flat structure, we can construct a new hierarchy using XSLT grouping:
            </p>
         
         
         <pre>&lt;xsl:for-each-group select="$students" group-by="?email"&gt;
&lt;xsl:map&gt;
&lt;xsl:map-entry key="'email'" select="?email"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:map-entry key="'first'" select="?first"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:map-entry key="'last'" select="?last"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:map-entry key="'courses'"&gt;
&lt;saxon:array&gt;
&lt;xsl:for-each select="current-group()"&gt;
&lt;saxon:array-member select="?course"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/saxon:array&gt;
&lt;/xsl:map-entry&gt;
&lt;/xsl:map&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each-group&gt;</pre>
         
         
         
         <p>This can then be serialized using the JSON output method to produce to required output.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Note: the <code>saxon:array</code> and <code>saxon:array-member</code> instructions already exist in Saxon
            9.8. They fill an obvious gap in the XSLT 3.0 facilities for handling arrays - a gap
            that exists largely because the XSL WG was unwilling to create a dependency XPath
            3.1.
            </p>
         
         
         
         <p><b>Use Case 3: conversion to HTML</b></p>
         
         
         
         <p>This use case isn't in the XML Prague paper, but is included here for completeness.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            The aim here is to construct an HTML page containing the information from a JSON document,
            without significant structural alteration. This is a classic use case for the recursive
            application of template rules, so the aim is to make it easy to traverse the JSON
            structure using templates with appropriate match patterns.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Unfortunately, although the XSLT 3.0 facilities allow patterns that match maps and
            arrays, they are cumbersome to use. Firstly, the syntax is awkward:
            </p>
         
         
         <pre>match=".[. instance of map(...)]"</pre>
         </p>
      <p>
         We can solve this with a Saxon extension allowing the syntax
         </p>
      <pre>match="map()"</pre>
      <p>Secondly, the type of a map isn't enough to distinguish one map from another. To identify
         a map representing a student, for example, we aren't really interested in knowing
         that it is a <code>map(xs:string, item()*)</code>. What we need to know is that it has fields
         (email, first, last). Fortunately another Saxon extension comes to our aid: tuple
         types, described here: <a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2016/09/tuple-types-and-type-aliases.html">https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2016/09/tuple-types-and-type-aliases.html</a>
         With tuple types we can change the match pattern to
         </p>
      <pre>match="tuple(email, first, last)"</pre>
      <p>Even better, we can use type aliases:</p>
      <pre>&lt;saxon:type-alias name="student" as="tuple(email, first, last)"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="~student"&gt;...&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
      <p>With this extension we can now render this input JSON into HTML using the stylesheet:</p>
      <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;

&lt;xsl:stylesheet
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="3.0"
xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xmlns:saxon="http://saxon.sf.net/"
exclude-result-prefixes="#all"
expand-text="yes"

&lt;saxon:type-alias name="faculty" type="tuple(faculty, courses)"/&gt;
&lt;saxon:type-alias name="course" type="tuple(course, students)"/&gt;
&lt;saxon:type-alias name="student" type="tuple(first, last, email)"/&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="~faculty"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;{?faculty} Faculty&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="?courses?*"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="~course"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;{?course} Course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of students:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="?students?*"&gt;
&lt;xsl:sort select="?last"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:sort select="?first"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="~student"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{?first} {?last}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{?email}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template name="xsl:initial-template"&gt;
&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="json-doc('courses.json')"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
      <p>With only the facilities of the published XSLT 3.0 recommendation, the easiest way
         to transform JSON is often to convert it first to XML node trees, and then use the
         traditional XSLT techniques to transform the XML, before converting it back to JSON.
         </p>
      <p>
         With a few judiciously chosen extensions to the language, however, a wide range of
         JSON transformations can be achieved natively.
