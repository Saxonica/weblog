      <p>The XQuery FLWOR expression has semantics that are defined in terms of a sequence
         of tuples of variable bindings. This strange concept has never really had any direct
         representation in Saxon, because it simply isn't needed. The vast majority of XQuery
         1.0 FLWOR expressions are equivalent to a nested loop delivering a sequence of items,
         like nested xsl:for-each instructions in XSLT. There's only one case in XQuery 1.0
         that can't be handled using this model, and that's a FLWOR expression that has two
         or more "for" clauses, and an "order by" clause that doesn't break down into a major
         key that depends on the outer "for" variable, and a minor key that depends on the
         inner "for" variable. It's actually quite hard to construct a realistic example that
         exploits this feature, so the fact that the Saxon implementation is somewhat bizarre
         doesn't really matter too much, because it is very rarely needed.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         XQuery 3.0, however, introduces several new clauses to the FLWOR expression. In fact,
         it's no longer a FLWOR expression because it now has an optional "count" clause, an
         optional "group by" clause, and an optional "window" clause - so it's now a FLWCGWOR
         expression. Not a term that is very likely to catch on. However, all these new constructs
         are defined essentially as operations that take a stream of tuples as input, and deliver
         a stream of tuples as output. So to implement these features, Saxon really needs to
         have some proper machinery for handling tuples. It's an odd state of affairs, having
         these composable constructs ("clauses") that aren't actually expressions, manipulaling
         things ("tuples") that aren't actually values, but that's the way XQuery works. It
         seems to have something to do with a relational algebra heritage, where operations
         defined in terms of tuples are of course the core stuff of the data model.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         To understand what these strange things called tuples are, it might help to start
         with simple examples and gradually increase the complexity. Consider the expression
         for $x in //a where $x[@b] return ($x+1)
         Here there's only one variable, so the tuple is a 1-tuple. The formal model of FLWOR
         expressions is that there is a sucession of values of the variable $x (as many as
         there are elements selected by //a) acting as input to the "where" clause, and the
         output is another succession of values of $x (this time containing as many values
         as match the predicate [@b]). The "return" clause then takes this stream of 1-tuples
         as input, and turns it into a sequence of items that are now regular values which
         can be stored in variables, passed to functions, and so on. Saxon actually implements
         this succession of 1-tuples as a sequence of items (with pipelined evaluation, of
         course, so it never holds the whole sequence in memory); because they are 1-tuples,
         they can be treated as regular values and don't require any special treatment.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         Now consider this expression:
         for $d in //dept, $e in //empl order by $e/salary return $d/name
         This is where things start getting weird, and where we need to understand tuples.
         The semantics are defined as delivering a sequence of ($d, $e) pairs (one pair for
         each department, employee combination), sorting this sequence of pairs by $e/salary,
         and then for each pair computing $d/name. Saxon does this by exploiting the "ObjectValue"
         class, which is a kind of XPath Item that encapsulates any Java object. It was designed
         to allow Java extension functions to return values that can be passed transparently
         to other Java extension functions, but it allows us to pack any kind of data we like
         into an Item, and this enables us to reuse all the machinery for handling sequences
         of items when we want to handle a sequence of tuples.
         In fact Saxon doesn't just pack the values of ($d, $e) into this composite pseudo-item,
         it also adds the values of the sort keys, and indeed the return value. Rather than
         sorting the input stream and then computing the return value for each tuple in the
         sorted input, we compute the return values for every item in the input before doing
         the sort. So we end up in effect with a sequence of values each of which has the form
         (salary, name); we sort this sequence on the value of salary, and then deliver the
         value of name. In contrast with the model described in the spec where the tuple holds
         the input variables ($d, $e), in the Saxon implementation the tuple holds the precomputed
         value of the return clause. Which means it doesn't actually need to contain the input
         values, because they will not be needed again.
         Precomputing the return value, and sorting all the return values along with the input
         tuples, is probably rather inefficient, at any rate in its use of memory. Also, it
         only works because a FLOWR expression can only have a single ORDER BY clause and a
         single RETURN clause. We therefore never need to implement a pipeline of operations
         working on the tuple stream; we only ever do one operation, which is sorting.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         To implement the extended FLWOR expression, we probably need to do something that
         is closer to the model used to describe the semantics. In this implementation the
         "stream of tuples" can be represented simply as a pair of integers, the location on
         stack where the values of $d and $e are held. When we ask for the next tuple, the
         contents of these variables change, but we don't actually need to return anything:
         it's more of an advance() operation with side-effects than a get-next() operation.
         The evaluation of the FLWOR expression as a whole can now be modelled like this (it's
         easiest to think of it in push mode, though Saxon will more often be using pull):
         until (exhausted) {
         advance();
         return compute-result();
         }
         where advance() advances the tuple stream causing the values of the relevant variables
         $d and $e to be updated on the stack, and compute-result() evaluates the return clause
         based on these values of the variables. In the case where there's an "order by" clause,
         the "order by" pseudo-expression works like this:
         until exhausted() {
         advance();
         compute-sort-keys();
         add-to-list(L);
         }
         sort(L)
         and when it in turn is called to advance(), it gets the next tuple from the sorted
         list, and updates the slots for $d and $e in the local stack frame. The sorted list
         needs to contain the values of the variables ($d, $e) and the sort keys, as at present,
         but it does not need to hold the result value; that should be computed after sorting.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         This looks like quite a substantial change, and it's because it feels fairly daunting
         that we haven't implemented this part of XQuery 3.0 in Saxon yet (the GROUP BY subset
         that's implemented in Saxon 9.3 is essentially the subset that can be implemented
         using conventional sequences of items, without resorting to the complexities of tuples.
         It also happens to match what XSLT implements, and what 99% of users actually need).
         However, I think I'm starting to understand what needs to be done to make this happen.
         Excuse me airing my thoughts in public, it always helps me to get my ideas straight
         to try and explain them to the world! I had been thinking of putting most of this
         off beyond Saxon 9.4, but I'm starting to feel more confident in tackling some of
         the changes sooner.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         The fact that other XQuery WG members have started contributing test material is an
         encouragement: implementation is always far easier if there are test cases available
         before you start.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         POSTSCRIPT: 1 August 2011
         I have now implemented a tuple stream pipeline that handles the for, let, where, order-by,
         group-by, and count clauses of XQuery 3.0 - everything, in fact, except windowing.
         It all works quite neatly. It's a pull pipeline only at the moment, and there is currently
         no optimization. Rather than re-implement all existing optimizations of FLWOR expressions,
         in the short term I shall probably take the new FLWOR expression and rewrite it where
         possible into familiar forms that the optimizer already knows how to handle, so that
         the new tuple stream evaluation strategy is used only in cases where tuples are actually
         necessary, for example anything involving "group-by", anything with "order-by" over
         more than one range variable, anything with a "count" clause, and so on. Adding a
         push version of the pipeline should not be difficult, and is certainly worth doing
         for cases where the results of the FLWOR expression are written straight to the serializer.
