      <p>For ever and a day, Saxon has tried to ensure that when several transformations are
         run using the same stylesheet and the same source document(s), any indexes built for
         those documents are reused across transformations. This has always required some careful
         juggling of Java weak references to ensure that the indexes are dropped from memory
         as soon as either the executable stylesheet or the source document are no longer needed.
         </p>
      <p>
         I've now spotted a flaw in this design. It wasn't reported by a user, and it didn't
         arise from a test case, it simply occurred to me as a theoretical possibility, and
         I have now written a test case that shows it actually happens. The flaw is this: if
         the definition of the key includes a reference to a global variable or a stylesheet
         parameter, then the content of the index depends on the values of global variables,
         and these are potentially different in different transformations using the same stylesheet.
         </p>
      <p>
         Fixing this is not easy, and poses some interesting dilemmas, given that no-one has
         hit the problem in a dozen years and it's quite likely that no-one ever will. It would
         be nice to roll back my discovery of the problem and pretend that it doesn't exist,
         but that's not my style.
         </p>
      <p>
         One solution would be to abandon the strategy of reusing indexes. It's likely that
         very few users have workloads that benefit from this strategy. On the other hand,
         those that do could see a big performance hit. Removing an powerful optimization because
         of a problem that doesn't apply to these workloads is not very friendly.
         </p>
      <p>
         The right solution is to identify those key definitions that allow indexes to be shared
         and distinguish them from indexes that can't be shared, and then manage the two kinds
         of index differently. Both the identification and the management can be done, but
         they introduce more complexity and hence more risk of bugs, and the whole thing feels
         like overkill given that we don't know any users who have the problem.
         </p>
      <p>
         Civil engineers design structures to withstand storms that are likely to happen more
         than once in N years. It would be nice if we could adopt a similar approach here.
         But software doesn't seem to be like that; it seems to follow Murphy's law, which
         states that if something can go wrong, it will.
         </p>
      <p>
         So with heavy heart, I think that there's no alternative to "doing the right thing",
         with all the complexity it entails.
