      <p>I've been embarking on an exercise to redesign the Saxon expression tree. It's got
         a number of problems that it would be nice to fix; and there's major work ahead in
         being able to save and restore the tree as part of a compiled XSLT 3.0 package, so
         it would be nice to get the structure into better shape first.
         </p>
      <p>
         One of the problems is that there's 150-odd different implementation classes for nodes
         on the expression tree, and that's before you start counting individual function calls;
         and there's far too much duplication between these classes. Implementing a new kind
         of expression involves far too much code. In addition, there's far too much scope
         to get this code wrong, leading to obscure bugs when a new kind of expression gets
         involved in some particular optimization rewrite, such as function or variable inlining.
         There's a steady flow of bugs, perhaps a couple a month, caused by tree corruptions
         of one kind or another, and it would be nice to make the whole structure more robust.
         </p>
      <p>
         One thing I want to do is to be more systematic about the way in which static context
         information is held on the tree. At present the principle is that each expression
         saves that part of the static context that it thinks it might need. For example, some
         expressions need run-time access to the static base URI, some to the static namespace
         context, and some to the register of collation names. (This last case has been simplified
         in 9.6 because all collation names are now global to a Configuration, though the default
         collation can still vary from one expression to another). A recent shock discovery
         is that in XPath 3.0, general comparisons (that is, the humble "=" operator) can depend
         on the namespace context - if one operand turns out to be untyped atomic and another
         is a QName, then the untyped atomic value needs to be converted to a QName using the
         in-scope namespaces. This means the namespace context needs to be saved with every
         general comparison expression, which is heavy stuff. Given that the static context
         is almost always the same for all expressions in a module, it would be much better
         rather than saving what each expression thinks it might need, to save the changes
         to the static context on the tree, so each expression can discover the whole static
         context by processing a set of deltas held with its ancestors in the tree.
         </p>
      <p>
         This leads to another point, which is that it would be nice to have parent pointers
         in the expression tree. At present you can navigate from a node to its children (that
         is, its subexpressions), but not in the other direction. Saxon gets around this by
         keeping a dynamic stack of expressions visited in some of its operations on the tree
         (such as type-checking and optimization) so the ancestor expressions are maintained
         dynamically during the recursive tree-walk rather than being maintained statically
         on the tree.
         </p>
      <p>
         In 9.6, mainly to support XSLT 3.0 streamability analysis, we introduced a generalized
         mechanism for obtaining the subexpressions of any node: the operands() method. This
         returns a set of Operand objects, each of which contains a pointer to the child expression
         itself, and also properties in effect of the parent-child expression relationship,
         such as the XSLT 3.0 posture and sweep properties, and the operand usage, used in
         the 3.0 general streamability rules. This mechanism has proved very successful (and
         not just for streaming) in enabling more generalized operations on the tree. But a
         limitation is that modtifications to the tree, such as substitution one child expression
         for another (which is very common during type-checking and optimization) is still
         entirely ad-hoc, and has to be managed independently by each class of expression node.
         </p>
      <p>
         As a first step in redesigning the tree for 9.7, I have extended the way in which
         we use Operand objects. As well as being used to navigate to subexpressions, they
         are also now used to modify subexpressions: the Operand object has a method setChildExpression()
         which can be used to replace the existing child expression with another. All structural
         changes to the tree are required to go via this method, which is enforced by encapsulating
         the reference to the child expression within the Operand object. The Operand also
         holds a reference to its "owner" expression, so when a child expression is changed,
         the single setChildExpression() method can take responsibility for housekeeping such
         as making sure the child expression has location information for use in error reporting,
         and making sure that expression properties cached on the parent node (such as the
         inferred type) are invalidated and recomputed when the children of the expression
         change.
         </p>
      <p>
         This process is complicated by the fact that the nodes on the expression tree are
         highly diverse, in fact they don't even all represent expressions. The tree also has
         to cater, for example, for XSLT patterns and XQuery FLWOR expression clauses.
         </p>
      <p>
         Making updates go through the Operand object enables many expressions to inherit a
         generic implementation of common rewrite methods such as typeCheck and optimize. For
         example, the default action of optimize is to call optimize() on each subexpression,
         and if any changes have occurred, replace the subexpression with its rewritten self.
         The redesign means that this "replace" operation can now be done in a generic way,
         meaning that the default optimize() method does not need to be tailor-made for each
         class of expression. The same is true of other methods such as primote().
         </p>
      <p>
         I was hoping that channelling all updates through Operand.setChildExpression() would
         also make it easy to maintain parent pointers in the tree. Unfortunately this is not
         the case. It's easy enough, when B is set as a child of A, for B's parent pointer
         to be updated to point to A. The problem arises when B's parent pointer was previously
         set to C: what happens to C's children? Can B be a child of A and C simultaneously
         (making it not a tree at all?). It turns out that some rewrites on the tree involve
         creating a new structure over existing leaf nodes in the tree, which might then be
         discarded if not all the conditions for optimization are met. So we've updated the
         parent pointers in the leaf nodes to this new superstructure, which we then discarded,
         reverting to the original. It's difficult then to make sure that the parent pointers
         are reset properly when the rewrite is abandoned. It can be done in an ad-hoc way,
         of course, but we're looking for something more robust: an API for tree rewriting
         that doesn't allow the tree to become inconsistent. This is proving hard to achieve.
         We may have to resort to a different approach, doing a bulk sweep of the tree to set
         all parent pointers before the typecheck and optimize operations on each template
         or function. This is intellectually unsatisfactory because it means accepting that
         the tree could be temporarily inconsistent in the middle of such an operation, but
         it may be the best option available.
         </p>
      <p>
         This is work in progress, but it's looking promising. I appreciate that for most users
         it's about as interesting as the repair works to the sewers beneath your street. Hopefully,
         though, the bottom line will be fewer product bugs, and more ability to take the product
         forward into new areas.
