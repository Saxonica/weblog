      <p>I've just got Saxon 8.7.3 out of the door, which fixes about 35 bugs found since 8.7.1
         was shipped two months ago. That prompts some thoughts about whether the number is
         too high and whether it can be reduced.</p>
      <p>I hope the following remarks don't sound too defensive:</p>
      <p>* During the life of Saxon 8.7.1 there were over 10,000 downloads. I bug for every
         300 downloads is not that bad.</p>
      <p>* This particular period coincided with the availability of new test suites from W3C,
         for both XSLT and XQuery. I'm not sure how many of the bugs this accounts for, but
         certainly a few.</p>
      <p>* A number of people are stress-testing Saxon, either because they incorporate Saxon
         technology in their own products, or because they are developing test suites for their
         own products and running the tests against Saxon is a good way of verifying the tests.</p>
      <p>* Quite a few of the bugs are in very obscure corners of the specification.</p>
      <p>The number of tests that I run before release is increasing all the time, to the extent
         that I'm a bit worried that the build cycle is becoming too long. However, there are
         definitely areas that are under-tested. There was a bug last week from a user who
         is writing an application that calls the public Saxon API that provides access to
         schema information. I have to confess that I don't have a single test in that area:
         if a user calls this API in a way that's significantly different from the way Saxon
         uses it internally, then they're in uncharted waters. In fact, it's generally true
         that the Java API is less thoroughly tested than the XSLT. XQuery, and XML Schema
         interfaces. Saxon's use of external interfaces such as DOM, JDOM, and DOM4J also gives
         occasional cause for concern - especially DOM, because that has multiple implementations
         that each have their own quirks. (XOM is better, because Wolfgang Hoschek does some
         thorough testing in that area.)</p>
      <p>In a pure open-source world, I tended to the view that users got what they paid for:
         I've never really gone in for the collaborative development angle on open-source,
         but I do incline to the view that testing is an activity where users have a legitimate
         part to play. It's less clear what the expectations should be with paid-for software.
         I don't feel comfortable taking money from people and shipping software that doesn't
         work. On the other hand, everyone in the software industry does it, and no-one knows
         how to avoid doing it. There are a lot of products costing 100 times the price people
         pay for Saxon that probably have 100 times as many bugs. If I spent an extra two weeks
         testing before each release, how many of those 35 bugs would I have found? Not many,
         I suspect.</p>
      <p>One way out of this is the formalisation of releases as "beta" releases, so customers
         know what they are getting. I've resisted that partly because I don't know myself,
         in advance, what customers are getting: every release will have bugs, and I don't
         know myself how many there will be, or how serious.</p>
      <p>Something I like to keep in mind is that the bugginess of a piece of
         software is the product of the number of bugs and their half-life. As well as minimizing
         the number of bugs that hit the field, it's important to eliminate them quickly through
         maintenance releases. Many software vendors are now tackling that through automated
         updating of installed software. That requires rather more investment in infrastructure
         than I've been able to make until now, but perhaps the time will come.</p>
      <p>One thing that I do propose to do once the current round of specs reach Recommendation
         status is to identify a release as a "gold" release, and maintain it for reliability
         - fix the bugs, and resist making any functionality changes or optimization changes.
         Users who need reliability rather than new features can then enjoy a period of stability.
         This mirrors what has happened with the 6.5.x series: the number of new bugs reported
         on 6.5.x is probably down to about one every three months, though I know the software
         is still very widely used.</p>
      <p>There are a few areas of the software that I know are more bug-prone than others.
         There's a tendency, for example, for the expression-rewriting performed by the optimizer
         to leave corruptions in the expression tree, such as infinite loops in the chain of
         "parent" pointers. The overloading of the TinyTree structure to hold sequences of
         parentless elements as well as holding a single well-formed document has also led
         to more than its fair share of problems. There's always an open question whether one
         should keep patching in the hope of squashing the last bug in such areas, or redesign
         from scratch. It depends partly on how much future change one expects to see in that
         area.</p>
      <p>Is there a conclusion to this little musing? Not really: there are no magic answers.
         I just want you to know that I'm not complacent about it, and that reliability features
         very high on my list of priorities.</p>
