      <p>While I was away on holiday last week, an unwelcome bug report arrived from Michael
         Allman. He pointed out that Saxon was implementing Unicode codepoint collation simply
         by doing a Java string compare, and that this is incorrect in the case of strings
         containing characters whose Unicode codepoint value is greater than 65535. Such characters
         are represented in Java by a pair of "char" values (called a surrogate pair), each
         of which is in the range 55296 to 56319; the effect is that such a character is sorted
         before one in the range 56320 to 65535. For example, the expression (&amp;_#60000; lt
         &amp;_#70000;) in the current Saxon release (8.7.3) returns false.</p>
      <p>This kind of bug is irritating, because hardly anyone is going to be affected by it,
         yet fixing it will impose a cost on everyone because string comparison will be slower.
         However, my philosophy is that conformance always comes first, so the first thing
         is to fix the bug. That's done, that was the easy part. Now let's see what we can
         do to minimize the damage on performance.</p>
      <p>First of all, we can try to ensure that the impact falls only on "less-than" comparisons
         and not on the more common "equals". That means implementing a comparesEqual() method
         in the collator that's separate from the compare() method, and changing ValueComparisons
         to use this method rather than calling the general compare() method and testing the
         result against zero. The compareEquals() method can use the Java String.equals() which
         will work fine on the Java string representation and gives the correct result.</p>
      <p>The next thing is to do some measurements. The most obvious thing affected by string
         comparison is sorting. So I wrote a little stylesheet that sorted all the words in
         a Shakespeare play (naturally!) and output the word that came last. First surprise:
         this took 2800ms (give or take)&nbsp; whether I used the new code or the old. A quick&nbsp;
         investigation with the debugger showed why: Saxon, in XSLT&nbsp; xsl:sort, doesn't use
         the Unicode codepoint collation by default, it uses the "linguistic" collation for
         the current Java locale. Does this mean the performance of codepoint collation isn't
         important? For many users, perhaps. However, codepoint collation is the default for
         XQuery, so we still need to look at it.</p>
      <p>So I changed the stylesheet to say collation="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/collation/codepoint".
         The transformation time went down from 2800ms to 546ms. So I've discovered something
         I didn't know: linguistic collation imposes an enormous overhead. This raises questions
         about whether I should change the default. I currently default to linguistic collation
         mainly for backwards compatibility, but the spec allows me to change it.</p>
      <p>Let's avoid that tangent and stick to the original objective of measuring the impact
         of fixing this bug. The figure of 546ms was with the new (fixed) code; making the
         same measurement with the old code (that is, Java string comparison) takes 401ms.
         So this confirms that there is indeed a significant overhead (35%), but perhaps it
         won't affect as many people as I feared.</p>
      <p>Further investigations with the debugger show that the strings being sorted (the output
         of tokenize() applied to nodes in a tiny tree) are StringValue objects that wrap a
         CharSlice object. A CharSlice is essentially a (char[], start, length) triple. In
         order to do the string comparison, we are doing a toString() operation on the CharSlice,
         and then looking at the first character of the string. Could we win the performance
         back by avoiding the conversion to a String object (which involves copying all the
         characters in the string)?</p>
      <p>It seems I can: with this change, the performance is down to 399ms. I've got to be
         careful, though, that the improvement is across-the-board, and is not specific to
         sorting the result of tokenize() (for example, at present I've only changed the path
         for sorting strings, whereas it's probably more common to sort untypedAtomic values).</p>
      <p>So let's try another test: this time I'll sort all the lines of all the plays and
         output the last one, which happens to be "youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel
         the". With the code in its state after the last change, this takes 2758ms. Revert
         to Java string comparison, and it takes 3075ms. </p>
      <p>When I go back to linguistic collation, incidentally, the time increases to 17928ms.
         (And the last line in alphabetical order is now the subject line of this article).</p>
      <p>Three conclusions from this exercise:</p>
      <p>(a) when you lose performance in one area, you can often win it back somewhere else.
         Doing a character-by-character compare is intrinsically more expensive than a string
         compare, except that it gives us the opportunity to avoid creating the String object.</p>
      <p>(b) when you do measurements, you often find unexpected opportunities. I now need
         to think about whether the very substantial performance savings from switching XSLT
         sorting to use codepoint collation by default are worth the compatibility hit for
         existing users. From a pure usability point of view, there are arguments both ways.
         XQuery opted to make codepoint collation the default for sorting because it was consistent
         with the default for "le", min/max, etc and that provides an argument in favour of
         the change.</p>
      <p>(c) simply studying the code in this area has revealed further opportunities for improvement.
         For example the AtomicSortComparer is doing an expensive series of "instance of" tests
         before it decides how to compare two values.&nbsp; We could use static type information
         to avoid much of this.</p>
      <p>So perhaps the bug report from Michael Allman wasn't so unwelcome after all. </p>
