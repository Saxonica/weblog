      <p>I made some minor changes to the details of expression evaluation a few days ago,
         and found that this broke the code for optimizing tail calls in recursive functions.
         Since that code has a nasty habit of breaking when I make small changes in this area,
         I decided that it was time for an overhaul.</p>
      <p>The basic idea of tail call optimization is that when a function calls itself as the
         last thing that it does, you don't actually need to create a new stack frame, because
         the old one can be reused. The main benefit is that you can recurse indefinitely deep
         without blowing the stack. You can tell products that don't include this optimization
         because they typically run out of stack space after 500 recursive calls or so.</p>
      <p>In the old design, Saxon wasn't actually reusing the original stack frame (it was
         just deleting the old stack frame before creating the new one). The tail-call was
         recognized and marked as such at compile time, and when it was executed, instead of
         calling the function, Saxon would create an object that encapsulated details of the
         function to be called, its parameters, and other bits of context. This would be passed
         down to the original caller of the recursive function, which would then execute the
         displaced function call, and carry on doing so until a "real" result was returned.
         The fragility of the mechanism came because there was a tendency either to intercept
         the function call package too early on its way down the stack, or to fail to intercept
         it when the time came for it to be caught by the original caller. </p>
      <p>Another recognized problem with the approach was that although Saxon was conserving
         space on the Java stack, it wasn't conserving space on the heap. Each function call
         created a new XPathContext object, which was linked to the XPathContext of its caller,
         leading to a chain of XPathContext objects in the heap as long as the depth of recursion.</p>
      <p>In the new design, the tail calls are still recognized and marked at compile time.
         In addition, if the function contains any tail calls, then its body is wrapped in
         a new TailCallLoop object. When the tail call is executed, the parameters of the function
         call are evaluated and written to the appropriate slots on the local stack frame.
         A marker is set in the XPathContext object, and the function call returns an empty
         sequence. This return value finds its way down to the TailCallLoop object, which executes
         the "real" body of the function repeatedly so long as it finds the marker in the XPathContext
         set to true.</p>
      <p>The new design appears to save significantly on creation of objects during the tail-call
         cycle, in particular the context objects and the function call package itself. It
         also seems a lot more robust in that the number of places in the code that need to
         understand the mechanism is much reduced. There is one downside: the old mechanism
         handled tail calls to any function, not just directly-recursive tail calls. This was
         sometimes useful in situations where two functions are mutually recursive.</p>
      <p>I think the new design can be extended to handle functions that are "almost tail-recursive",
         in that they perform a simple operation (typically a comparison, an addition, or a
         list append) when the tail call returns. An example of such a function is:</p>
      <p>declare function product($seq) {<br>&nbsp; if (empty($seq)) then 1 else  $seq[1]*product($seq[position()!=1])<br>}</p>
      <p>(which can be useful in calculating compound interest)</p>
      <p>There is a known technique to rewrite such functions as tail recursive functions by
         adding an extra parameter:</p>
      <p>declare function product2($seq, $n) {<br>&nbsp; if (empty($seq)) then $n else product($seq[position()!=1], $n*$seq[1])<br>
         }</p>
      <p>and this rewrite is now looking like a feasible proposition.</p>
      <p>Functions of course work exactly the same way in XSLT and XQuery. In XSLT there are
         also named templates and match templates. Saxon implements tail-call optimization
         on these, using a similar but separate technique to the old design for functions (in
         fact, this is where it came from). It's harder to see how these can be redesigned
         in the same way. Named templates could perhaps be turned into functions, though the
         need to maintain full context information, tunnel parameters and the like makes this
         difficult. Match templates are more difficult still because it is impossible to tell
         statically whether a tail call will be recursive or not. In any case, the implementation
         for templates seems to be less fragile, perhaps because templates are always invoked
         in "push" mode. In push mode, instructions don't actually return a result, instead
         they write to the current output destination. This means that the Java return value
         can be used to pass information about tail calls down the stack without the kind of
         overloading that was taking place for function calls.</p>
