      <p>Alain Frisch of INRIA has been doing some work on streaming transformations, including
         the development of a <a href="http://yquem.inria.fr/%7Efrisch/xstream/">language called XStream</a>. The project itself appears to be rather academic for the time being (for example,
         the language apparently doesn't support namespaces yet) but in the meantime there
         are some interesting <a href="http://yquem.inria.fr/%7Efrisch/xstream/bench.html">performance numbers</a> relevant to Saxon that are worth studying.</p>
      <p>In terms of competition, the numbers seem to confirm that Saxon is in the top tier
         of processors for both XQuery and XSLT. It's good to note that Saxon is the only processor
         tested whose throughput handling an 80Mb input file was higher than the 40Mb result.</p>
      <p>What's really interesting, though, is the fact that the Saxon XSLT performance is
         so much better than the XQuery figure. (2.21 vs 1.52 Mb/sec); and also the observation
         that this transformation benefited (in the case of XQuery) from using the -pull option
         on the command line.</p>
      <p>I've written a test data generator in XSLT so that I could investigate further, and
         I found that my results were very similar. I worked mainly with an input file of 23Mb
         - with smaller files, the results are too sensitive to Java startup costs, while with
         larger files, the need for large amounts of memory can cause thrashing unless you
         control very carefully what else is running on the machine. For this file, the best
         XSLT transformation time I achieved was 9.003 sec. The best XQuery time without the
         -pull option was 18.317 sec (half the speed), which improved to 14.571 sec with -pull.</p>
      <p>Why is XQuery slower? The answer is that XSLT templates are always executed in "push"
         mode: instructions that create new nodes are implemented by sending SAX-like events
         to the current output destination. In this example the current output destination
         is always the serializer, which means that the "result tree" doesn't in fact exist:
         everything is serialized as soon it is written. In XQuery, the code is written in
         terms of functions, and functions are evaluated in "pull" mode: the caller iterates
         over the items in the sequence supplied by the function. In this case, the function
         call constructs and returns a new element node. This element node is physically constructed
         in memory, the node is returned to the calling function , which then copies the new
         element into the tree it is creating. Since the function is actually recursive, this
         results in a great deal of copying of temporary trees.</p>
      <p>What effect does "-pull" have? In fact, the option -pull on the command line is not
         particularly well named. It has two effects: firstly, it sets what in the API is called
         "lazy construction mode". Secondly, it means that the top-level query expression (see
         class XQueryExpression) is evaluated using the pull() method instead of the run()
         method. The pull() method delivers the result of the query as a stream of StAX-like
         events, whereas run() causes the result to be pushed to the serializer as a sequence
         of SAX-like events.</p>
      <p>The key thing here is lazy construction mode. When a function body consists, as here,
         of an element constructor, then in lazy construction mode, the function call does
         not return a fully-constructed element, it instead returns a "virtual" element (class
         UnconstructedElement) which is really just a pointer to the instructions and data
         needed to construct the element when it is eventually needed. What happens next depends
         on what the caller of the function decides to do with the node. If it tries to evaluate
         a path expression, for example, then the node immediately gets built in memory, so
         nothing has been saved. In this benchmark, however, the caller adds the node to a
         new parent element, which, because the function is recursive, it itself a virtual
         element. So the effect of calling pull() on the top-level query expression is to immediately
         return a virtual element whose content is delivered recursively in terms of other
         virtual elements. The control code then reads StAX-like pull events representing this
         virtual element, and this can be done without ever constructing the element in memory.
         These events are then translated into push events and sent to the serializer. The
         net effect is to do much the same as the XSLT solution: instructions write events
         directly to the serializer, and the result tree is never materialized in memory. But
         it's still slower than the XSLT solution, probably because the logic of building virtual
         trees is more convoluted.</p>
      <p>What improvements are possible? It would be nice to get the XQuery speed up to the
         same level as the XSLT speed, and this clearly could be done if we could execute functions
         in the same way as XSLT executes templates, in push mode. Generally Saxon's strategy
         is to evaluate subexpressions in the same mode as the containing expression where
         possible: a simple "for" expression, for example, is executed in pull mode or push
         mode depending on the mode of the caller. If we made function calls amenable to processing
         in either mode, then this whole query would execute in push mode if started in push
         mode. The other thing we could try is to select "lazy construction mode" automatically
         when appropriate, rather than relying on a user switch. The reason we don't do this
         at present is that it sometimes performs far worse. But the rule suggested by this
         benchmark is: if the body of a function consists of an element constructor, use lazy
         construction mode for that function.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Alain for setting off this stream of thought. There have been few measurements
         comparing XSLT and XQuery performance on comparable tasks, and new measurements always
         yield new insights.</p>
