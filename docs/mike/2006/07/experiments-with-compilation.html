      <p>Some XSLT processors (XSLTC for example) compile stylesheets into Java bytecode (or
         equivalently, other intermediate codes such as CIL on .NET). I believe the technique
         is also used by some XQuery processors. Some users assume that a product that compiles
         to bytecode will be necessarily faster than an interpreter. I've tended to argue that
         high-level optimizations are more important, and that compiling expressions to bytecode
         might reduce the scope for high-level optimizations, if only by making them more complex
         to implement and debug.</p>
      <p>I set out today to do some experiments. First I wrote, by hand, the Java code that
         I would expect a bytecode compiler to generate in order to evaluate the path expression
         /site/regions/namerica/item against the XMark benchmark dataset. I did most of my
         experiments with the 10Mb version of this dataset, in which the above path expression
         selects 1000 elements. Then I tried to compare the performance of this hand-written
         code with the way that Saxon evaluates this expression.</p>
      <p>First problem: building the 10Mb tree takes around 1.4 seconds, while evaluating the
         path expression takes about 0.2ms. So we can immediately see that we're not going
         to get any worthwhile savings from compiled path expressions unless we execute a very
         large number of them. So I wrote code the execute the path expression repeatedly N
         times, with N going up to 50,000.</p>
      <p>Next problem: when the path expression was embedded in XSLT or XQuery, Saxon worked
         very hard to avoid evaluating it repeatedly. I found myself having a real struggle
         constructing an expression that defeated the optimizer and the lazy evaluation logic;
         in my early attempts, evaluating the path expression 50,000 times took no longer than
         evaluating it once. This rather verifies my earlier point that high-level optimizations
         are more important.</p>
      <p>When I finally found a way of constructing the loop that was too convoluted for the
         optimizer to do anything with, the problem was that I was executing a lot more code
         than the basic path expression. I solved this by modifying Saxon internally so that,
         while executing the XSLT code, it artificially invoked my hand-written code for this
         specific path expression rather than the general path expression code. This made the
         results for XSLT interpretation and the pretend-compiled code finally comparable.</p>
      <p>The pure handwritten code for the path expression took 5448ms for 50,000 iterations
         (each selecting 1000 nodes, remember): that's about 9 million nodes per second. Incorporating
         this into the stylesheet increased the time to 7591ms, because of the anti-optimization
         logic. The pure XSLT stylesheet took 10264ms. </p>
      <p>So, my conclusion is that there's potential to increase the speed of evaluation of
         path expressions by about 25% by compiling them down to bytecode or CIL. However,
         the typical stylesheet spends only a small amount of its time executing path expressions.
         The end-to-end benefit for most users is therefore likely to be rather smaller: perhaps
         10% at best.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there's also scope for compilation in other parts of the code, for example
         serialization. It's not obvious, though. More promisingly, perhaps there are higher
         savings to be made with more complex path expressions. As the academics say when applying
         for grant money, further research is needed.</p>
