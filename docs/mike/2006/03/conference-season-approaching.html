      <p>Conferences, like London buses, always seem to come in clusters. I've just been pausing
         for breath to see what I'm committed to...</p>
      <p><a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/">XTech in Amsterdam</a> is a little later this year: May 16-19. I offered a paper on XML-based application
         architecture, which was accepted: that means I've now got to write it! My plan is
         to develop the theme of the <a href="http://www.stylusstudio.com/xml/workflow.html">workflow article</a> published on the <a href="http://www.stylusstudio.com/">Stylus Studio</a> web site. I bumped into Erik Bruchez of <a href="http://www.orbeon.com/">Orbeon</a> in Edinburgh last week (we share a consulting client) and it was good to get an update
         on the new W3C standards initiative in the area of pipeline processing languages -
         an area that I think holds great promise for the future. I'm looking forward to XTech
         - they seem to have a successful formula, and most importantly, it's successful because
         the right people are there.</p>
      <p>That's closely followed by <a href="http://www2006.org/">WWW 2006</a> in Edinburgh from 23-26 May (I should get myself a permanent home there...). For
         some reason I haven't been on the WWWnnnn circuit for a long time. I wasn't expecting
         to be there but I've been invited to take part in a session that's being put together
         on W3C activity, so it will be interesting to see how the event shapes up.</p>
      <p>Next is a <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz/index.html">weekend conference in Prague</a>, June 17-18. I was there last year; a small-scale event with a relaxed ambience and
         a mainly local audience. I've accepted an invitation to speak and now have to make
         a decision what to speak about - should I adapt existing material (less work) or try
         to put together something new (more interesting)? Most of the other speakers have
         submitted their abstracts so I have the luxury of choosing a topic that complements
         what others are saying. Last year I took the family with me for the weekend, it's
         a lovely place for a short break except for the embarrassment of the hordes of English
         stag-party visitors who are only there to see how much cheap beer they can drink.</p>
      <p>The next week we have W3C working group meetings in Paris. I don't know how it happened,
         but by chance this is turning into a European season.</p>
      <p>Then on June 30th is the XQuery conference <a href="http://www.ximep-2006.org/">XIME-P</a>. This has a slightly academic flavour but it's no bad thing to keep in touch with
         what the researchers are doing, they occasionally have some good ideas. One of the
         attractive things about the XML field is that collaboration between academia and industry
         seems to be quite good: in the database field, where I used to work, it was rare to
         find an academic and a user at the same conference. Logistically this one will be
         tough, it's a single day in Chicago, but it will have been the first trip to the US
         since January: perhaps I can organize some other useful visits around it. I've submitted
         a paper for the conference (in the academic tradition this is the sort of event where
         papers are submitted and scrutinized, a complete contrast with an event like Prague
         where the aim is to assemble an interesting group of speakers and then ask them what
         they would like to talk about). I'm on the programme committee but there's nothing
         sleazy about this, one doesn't get to vote on one's own paper! It's quite a good discipline
         writing this kind of paper occasionally, though I found it very hard to keep to the
         limit of six pages.</p>
      <p>Finally (for this season!) and closer to home is the <a href="http://www.xmlsummerschool.com/">Oxford Summer School</a>, where I will once again be talking about XSLT 2.0. A bit like the Prague event,
         this has a very pleasant social atmosphere, especially if the sun shines; but it lasts
         a bit longer so when you come in on the last day you get the impression of a strong
         sense of bonding that has taken place over the week. My main problem in planning this
         event is that it's essentially a teaching event rather than a conference, and it's
         hard to work out what the right starting point for the students is: some are very
         new to XML, some are coming because they got a lot out of it last year and want to
         build on that. I think I'm a bit inclined to make the mistake of pitching too high;
         but Bob du Charme does the introductory stuff very well and perhaps the combination
         means there is something for everyone. Come to think of it, the date's been in my
         diary for a while but I need to confirm with the organisers...</p>
