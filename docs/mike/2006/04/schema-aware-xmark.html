      <p>Continuing the theme of my weekend postings, it occurred to me that the really interesting
         question is not "what happens to the performance of XMark if I run it under Saxon-SA",
         but "what happens to the performance of XMark if I make it schema-aware?". </p>
      <p>XMark as written has no schema, so to answer that question I had to create a schema
         (easily done with Stylus Studio) and modify the queries to use it. For Q1 that means
         changing:</p>
      <p><code>for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $b in /site/people/person[@id="person0"]</code><br>
         <code>return $b/name</code></p>
      <p>to</p>
      <p>i<code>mport schema "" at "schema.xsd";</code><br><code>declare variable $in as document-node(schema-element(site)) := .;&nbsp;&nbsp; </code></p>
      <p><code>for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $b in $in/site/people/person[@id="person0"]</code><br><code>return $b/name</code></p>
      <p>XMark was written by one of those people who imagines that every query needs to be
         a FLWOR expression. This one, of course, is equivalent to the simple path expression
         <code>/site/people/person[@id="person0"]</code><code>/name</code>. But one of the rules of running benchmarks is to run the code as written, however
         tempted you are to improve it. As it happens, there's no performance penalty in this
         case: though there's scope for a much bigger improvement once the query is schema-aware:
         it could be rewritten as <code>id('person0')/name</code>.</p>
      <p>One query, Q14, threw a type error after making this change. It turned out it was
         using the construct <code>contains(description, ... )</code>: in the schema, description is an element with element-only content, and you aren't
         allowed to atomize such an element, so I had to rewrite this as <code>contains(string(description), ...)</code>. </p>
      <p>I wasn't expecting the change to make a great deal of difference to the performance,
         and the purpose of the exercise was really to check that this assumption was valid.
         Some researchers make great claims for the benefits that schema-awareness can give
         in improving performance, but I think these are only likely to occur when you are
         running against a database with pre-built indexes. In this case the type analysis
         helps the optimizer to identify where it's possible to make use of indexes. The only
         thing Saxon can do with the information is to eliminate a few redundant type-checking
         and conversion steps, and these are not usually very costly. I've never claimed performance
         improvements as the big selling-point of schema awareness: the benefits are much more
         to do with finding bugs in your stylesheets and queries more quickly.</p>
      <p>The first thing I found (using the -e explain output) was that Saxon wasn't doing
         the type analysis quite as thoroughly as it should. There were a couple of places
         where it wasn't using all the information available, and this meant that it was actually
         generating the redundant checking and conversion code in many places. So the first
         step was to fix that.</p>
      <p>In the actual performance data, my expectation turned out to be correct for the most
         part: making the queries schema-aware had little effect on their performance. But
         there was one surprise: two of the queries, Q11 and Q12, were taking about twice as
         long. These are the queries that do a "non-equijoin" - they use the join condition</p>
      <p><code>where $p/profile/@income &gt; (5000 * $i)</code></p>
      <p>which Saxon-SA can't currently optimize, so they are evaluating $p and $i using nested
         loops.</p>
      <p>A bit of further investigation (using the Java profiling option -Xrunhprof) showed
         the reason for the slowdown: @income was defined in the schema as being xs:decimal,
         and $i is also decimal, so in the schema-aware case the join condition was being
         evaluated using decimal arithmetic, whereas the non-schema-aware case used double
         precision floating point. Decimal is a lot slower than double, and when I changed
         the schema to use xs:double, the difference in performance disappeared.</p>
      <p>What have we learned from this exercise? Firstly, it showed up cases where the type
         inferencing can be improved, and Saxon 8.7.1 will benefit from these improvements.
         Along the way, I also improved the "explain" output so it gives more information about
         the types that were inferred, which should help in future to identify similar opportunities
         for further improvements.</p>
      <p>It's interesting that decimal is so much worse than double, and this is information
         that will come in useful when advising users how to tune their workload. It also shows
         that simple arithmetic and comparison operations can account for a lot of the query
         execution cost, which suggests that this is an area that deserves more attention in
         Saxon. Saxon actually stores nodes with their string value rather than their typed
         value. In a case like this that involves n^2 comparisons, this means there's a big
         potential saving in only doing the string-to-number conversion for each value once.
         It might be possible to achieve this simply by making it an explicit operation on
         the expression tree, in which case it will automatically get moved out of the loop.
         There's an alternative solution, which is to hold typed values on the TinyTree. I've
         been hesitant to do that because for many use cases it would impose a significant
         cost with no corresponding benefit, but it might be worth doing under control of a
         new configuration option. (But I hate configuration options. Each such option doubles
         the testing load, and 99% of the users will never know the option exists because the
         documentation is far too big already).</p>
      <p>For Q11 and Q12, however, this doesn't get to the core of the issue. The top priority
         for these queries is to use a better join algorithm than nested loop. That means looking
         at some kind of sort-merge approach.</p>
      <p>One final idea: the first query we looked at, Q1, is equivalent to a call on the id()
         function. Could we automate this rewrite? It certainly looks possible: Saxon is already
         doing the same kind of thing in XSLT if there is an xsl:key index defined. The simplest
         way of doing that is to handle id() the way we already handle idref(), as a special
         case of the XSLT key() function using a system-defined internal key definition. </p>
      <p>There's never any shortage of opportunities for improving the product! Anyone care
         to sponsor any of these developments?</p>
