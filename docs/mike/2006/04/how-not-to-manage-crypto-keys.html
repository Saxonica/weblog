      <p>A tale of woe here: I don't expect any sympathy, but someone might learn from my mistakes!</p>
      <p>Generally as soon as I've finished a Saxon release I do something approaching a full
         backup: at any rate, all the directories that contain things I would be embarrassed
         to lose. Doing this after shipping Saxon 8.7.1, I found a few disk errors were reported,
         which chkdsk confirmed: so it looked like a good time to install a larger hard disk
         in my laptop and rebuild my system. A tedious process which occupied many spare hours
         over the Easter weekend when I wasn't in church, attending choir rehearsals, playing
         croquet, or punting on the river... Anyway, it seemed to go smoothly. One or two minor
         hiccups like finding that the saved setup file for UltraEdit was from a different
         version than the saved license key, but that's the sort of thing you expect. </p>
      <p>(Generally this sort of upgrade is a good opportunity to move forwards on various
         software packages - but oddly, the software vendors don't encourage you to take this
         opportunity because they usually make you reinstall the old version before you can
         install the new one!)</p>
      <p>Anyway, I'm left with one problem: the rebuilt system issues Saxon-SA license keys
         on .NET that are incompatible with the issued software. Java licenses are fortunately
         OK, but not .NET.</p>
      <p>How did this happen?</p>
      <p>The IKVM/GNU Classpath technology used to build the Saxon product on .NET offers pretty
         comprehensive emulation of the JDK class library, but one of the exceptions is crypto
         services, which I use for license key generation. So I reimplement the license issue
         tool to use .NET crypto services instead. After reading up on this immensely feature-rich
         set of capabilities, the process I followed was to create a .snk file containing the
         private/public key pair, then save this in a "key container" with a well-known name.
         The public key of course goes out with the issued software, the private key is accessed
         from the key container by the license issue tool to create a license key file in the
         form of a signed XML document.</p>
      <p>When I tried to repeat this process on the new machine, it seems that the .snk file
         that I saved in my backups contained different keys from the ones held in the key
         container that was actually being used to generate the license files. So I tried to
         export the keys from the key container - there's a method ToXmlString(true) that ought
         to do the trick - but it didn't work, saying that it's not possible to export the
         private key from this kind of key container.</p>
      <p>Sadly, I think the only way forward is to create a new build of Saxon-SA on .NET,
         with a new private/public key pair. The only redeeming feature of this story is that
         the problem occurred at a stage where the number of users of Saxon-SA on .NET is still
         relatively modest.</p>
      <p>If anyone is thinking of following the advice in the MSDN .NET documentation which
         says that private/public key pairs should only be held in key containers, then I suggest
         you test your backup and recovery strategy! Otherwise, keeping the .SNK file in a
         safe place would seem to be the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>POSTSCRIPT (Sept 2006)</p>
      <p>I again had the task of copying the license issueing software to a new machine, and
         my first few attempts were worryingly unsuccessful. Everything appeared to work on
         the new machine, but the license keys it generated were deemed to have an invalid
         signature. </p>
      <p>I eventually found a route that worked: here it is, for the record.</p>
      <p>First produce the XML from the key container, use the aspnet_regiis utility found
         in<br>c:/WindowsNT/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v2.0.50727.</p>
      <p>To export the key from key container LicenseKeyPair as XML (the -pri option ensures
         both the public and private keys are exported):</p>
      <p>&nbsp;aspnet_regiis -px LicenseKeyPair c:\temp\LicenseKeyPair.xml -pri<br>&nbsp;<br>To import the key from the XML into a key container on another machine:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;aspnet_regiis -pi LicenseKeyPair c:\temp\LicenseKeyPair.xml</p>
