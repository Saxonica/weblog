      <p>The quality of the Saxon product benefits enormously from the contributions of a dozen
         or so "power-users": as soon as I upload a new release, they run it through all their
         regression tests and often give me the bad news within hours. </p>
      <p>In this case it was a performance problem with the new floating-point to string conversion
         routines. Wolfgang Hoschek found that one or two of the (ten thousand) XQuery <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/test-suite/">XQTS </a>tests were running hideously slowly.</p>
      <p>What happened was this. I had decided to bring the code for floating-point to string
         conversion in-house, for a couple of reasons: firstly, the IKVMC implementation that
         I was using on the .NET platform had unacceptable bugs, and secondly, Saxon was doing
         some very inefficient post-processing of the result of Java's float output to make
         it conform to XPath rules, and I felt there were savings to be had by avoiding this.</p>
      <p>I looked around for some reusable code to do the job, and hit on some routines written
         by Jack Shirazi that&nbsp; appeared suitable.&nbsp; A few tests showed that they were sometimes
         producing an answer that was just a little bit too high or too low as a result of
         rounding errors, so I added a tweak to detect this situation and correct it. Some
         fairly thorough testing showed that  after this change, it was getting the right answers,
         and some quick performance checks showed acceptable performance.</p>
      <p>However, it turned out that there were a few cases where Shirazi's code was getting
         the answer badly wrong. Because it was calculating the exponent and mantissa separately,
         using floating point arithmetic it would sometimes format a value such as 0.00001
         not as 1.0e-5 or 0.99999e-5 but as 9.99999e-5. My "tweak" was picking up that the
         answer was wrong and was then applying a million small adjustments to get it right
         - finally delivering the correct answer after about 30 seconds.</p>
      <p>So: back to the drawing board. I decided to do a bit more searching of the literature
         and everything seemed to point to a paper published by Guy Steele and Jon White at
         SIGPLAN 1990. (They had actually written it ten years earlier, but being engineers
         rather than academics, publishing was not high on their list of priorities.) Over
         the weekend I forked out $10 to download a copy of the paper and set about implementing
         their algorithm, and today I uploaded the resulting <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1439685&amp;group_id=29872&amp;atid=397617">replacement module</a>. In due course, it will find its way into an 8.7.1 release.</p>
      <p>Are there lessons to be learned? I could adopt the approach of taking less risk -
         not changing things in case they break. I don't believe in that strategy, at least
         not until I get to a point where there is a release I want to advertise as a stable,
         gold star release. Saxon got where it is by moving fast, and very often benefiting
         from the contributions of "power users" like Wolfgang. One thing that is important
         is to get rid of bugs fast once they are found: the bugginess of the product is the
         number of bugs multiplied by their half-life, and both factors need to be addressed.
         One thing that concerns me now (especially with the .NET platform becoming available)
         is that it's taking increasingly long to ship a release. I need to invest more in
         automating the process, especially in detecting genuine test failures.</p>
