      <p>Saxon includes code to translate the XPath regex syntax into the
         regex dialect supported by Java - a wonderful piece of code originally
         written by James Clark, as usual hiding its brilliance with a total
         absence of comments. One of the main things it does is to expand the
         regex into one that matches surrogate pairs (characters above 65535),
         which JDK 1.4 doesn't handle natively.</p>
      <p>Only problem: JDK 1.5 does handle characters above 65535 in its
         regex library; and what's more, if you try to match the two halves of a
         surrogate pair as if they were separate characters, then it doesn't
         work. And that of course is just what Saxon is doing. So the
         paradoxical situation is that with Saxon, regular expressions handling
         non-BMP characters work on JDK 1.4 (where they aren't supported by the
         platform) but fail on JDK 1.5 (where they are).</p>
      <p>I think I've fixed this by writing a new version of the translator
         for use under 1.5, which cuts out all the clever stuff. The only
         problem now is that I really don't have enough test cases to be sure
         it's working properly.</p>
      <p>I'v also been looking at the regex support in .NET 1.1. It looks
         pretty compatible with JDK 1.4: the only difference I've found so far
         is that JDK 1.4 supports the "&amp;&amp;" operator (for example
         [A-Z&amp;&amp;[^IO]], which the translator generates for the XPath
         regex [A-Z-[IO]]) - and .NET doesn't. It seems to be possible to handle
         this as (?=[A-Z])[^IO] instead, which works on both platforms.</p>
