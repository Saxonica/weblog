      <p>After two years without any visible signs of progress, the XQJ expert group has published
         a new set of Java API specifications for XQuery. (Quite an achievement to use those
         three letters in an acronym, I think!) The specs can be downloaded at <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=225">http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=225</a></p>
      <p>This isn't a final spec, but I would guess that the key design decisions are now fixed
         and that changes from now on will be refinements to the details of individual methods.</p>
      <p>As one would hope, it's a much more polished specification than the last one back
         in 2004. There are still a few things in it that I don't like all that much: it's
         very JDBC-like in its overall approach, being built around the concept that there
         is a "Connection" between the application and the XQuery server (which they clearly
         think of a database system). The XQConnection has all sorts of behaviour, like logging
         on specifying a user name and password, and protocol for closing the connection and
         specifying timeouts, that don't make much sense in an environment like Saxon where
         the XQuery engine operates in-process. But given that the spec has been driven by
         Oracle and IBM, that's not too surprising.</p>
      <p>The way result sets are managed also seems rather clumsy. The XQResultSequence object
         contains both a sequence of items and a current position, whereas to me a much more
         natural design is to separate the collection and its iterator in separate objects.
         Rather than having a single method "getCurrentItem()" which returns an Item and allows
         you access to all the methods available for Items, the XQSequence object duplicates
         all these methods and interprets them as operating on the current item in the sequence.
         The net result of this kind of approach is that there's a very large number of methods
         neeing to be coded: a lot of them end up being one-liners.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a compiled query (XQPreparedQuery) and the context for its execution (context
         item, values of parameters) are combined in a single object, which is unfortunate
         because it means that the XQPreparedQuery object cannot be used safely across multiple
         concurrent threads.</p>
      <p>There's also a "metadata" facility (metadata in the sense that database people use
         the term) that allows you to ask for details of things like available collections,
         documents, extension functions, and collations. This seems to assume a rather "closed
         world" implementation - with Saxon, producing a list of all the documents that are
         available to a query (i.e. the whole of the web) is hardly a feasible proposition!.</p>
      <p>But still, these are minor complaints. The value of a standard API depends more on
         how well specified it is, which in turn tends to lead to compatible behaviour across
         implementations. On that score, I think they've done a fairly reasonable job. There
         are many points of detail that will require clarification.</p>
      <p>I've started sketching out an implementation of XQJ for Saxon, and there don't seem
         to be any major points of difficulty. All the underlying functionality, including
         interfaces to DOM, StAX, and SAX, is there already, it's just a new skin. The real
         challenge will be testing - not just because there are so many methods, but because
         there's limited value in testing that a method does what I thought it was meant to
         do, when the real danger is that the spec-writer intended it to mean something quite
         different. It will be interesting to see if the XQJ group decides to publish its test
         suite. Given that the whole exercise has been horribly delayed by the antics of corporate
         lawyers (I won't say whose), I'm not holding my breath.</p>
      <p>I wrote a few weeks ago about <a href="/mike/2006/03/apis-for-xml-processing.html">Saxon's new API on the .NET platform</a>, and about the prospects of porting this to Java. I haven't made a decision on this
         yet: the trade-off between a patchwork of "standard" but increasingly incoherent APIs
         (JAXP, XQJ, etc) and a coherent but Saxon-specific API is a difficult one. Technically
         it's quite feasible to do both and let the user decide. The other challenge is what
         to do about the existing XQuery API in Saxon, which I would love to kill off unceremoniously
         if only I could get away with it.<br>
