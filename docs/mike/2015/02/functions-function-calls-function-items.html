      <p>XSLT and XQuery, in their 3.0
         incarnations, have become fully functional programming languages,
         where functions are first class values that can be manipulated in the
         same way as other values, for example they can be bound to variables
         and passed as arguments to other functions. So you would expect that
         functions play a pretty central role in the Saxon implementation. In
         this article I shall review how functions work within Saxon, and how
         I think this needs to change.</p>
      <p>One of the things that happens when
         features are added to a complex piece of software is that they tend
         to be added around the edges, rather than in the core. You can tell
         when something was added by how central it is to the class hierarchy.
         It shouldn't be that way, but there are good reasons why it happens.
         And when we look at how functions work in Saxon, that's what we see.
         For example, if we had always had dynamic function calls, then we
         would probably find that static function calls (where the function to
         be called is known at compile time) were treated simply as a special
         case of dynamic calls, much as ($x+1) is treated as a special case of
         ($x+$y). But because they came along later, dynamic calls are
         actually handled very differently.</p>
      <p>I've been doing work recently on the
         design of Saxon's expression tree (the data structure produced by the
         compilation phase for use by the execution phase of stylesheet and
         query evaluation). One aspect of that has been working out how to
         write the expression tree to persistent storage, and then load it
         back again for execution. In doing this, I've been struck by the
         sheer number of different classes that are somehow related to
         functions, and by the lack of coherence between them.</p>
      <p>The first thing we notice, which is in
         itself a bit smelly, is that there is no class called Function. In
         fact, for many functions, there is no object in Saxon that represents
         the function itself. For example, with system functions (recall that
         in XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 that's the only kind there were), we have
         two things: a data table containing general information about
         functions, such as their type signatures and context dependencies,
         and a class SystemFunctionCall which actually represents a call to
         the function, not the function itself. The implementation of
         functions such as name() or substring() is in a class called Name or
         Substring which is a subclass of SystemFunctionCall. This in turn is
         a subclass of Expression, and as such it forms a node in the
         expression tree.</p>
      <p>This works fine for static function
         calls, but what happens to an expression such as substring#3 or
         true#0 or name#0? Answer: different things in each of these three
         cases.</p>
      <p>For substring#3, this is a pure
         function: there are no context dependencies. We create something
         called a SystemFunctionItem, which is an Item (and therefore a
         Sequence), we wrap this inside a Literal, and we put the Literal on
         the expression tree. This is much the same as the way we handle a
         constant such as "London" or 39. Internally, the
         SystemFunctionItem contains a reference to an instance of the
         Substring class, which is where things get a bit peculiar, because
         Substring is designed to be a function call, not a function. In fact,
         Substring has a dual personality, it tries to act in both roles
         depending which methods you call. That's a hack, and like all hacks,
         it comes back to bite you.</p>
      <p>For true#0 there's a further bit of
         hackery, because the function call true() doesn't actually generate a
         SystemFunctionCall, it generates a BooleanValue: it's treated as a
         constant, just like "London" or 39. But we have to support
         dynamic calls on true(), so we introduced a SystemFunctionCall called
         True to handle this case, even though it doesn't have the dual
         personality: it acts only as a function, never as a function call.</p>
      <p>The name#0 function is different again,
         because it encapsulates context. It's defined to return the name of
         the node that was the context node at the point where the name#0
         expression was evaluated. So this should remind us that name#0 is not
         a value, it is an expression: the function it represents has no
         static existence, it can only be created dynamically by evaluating
         the expression with a particular dynamic context. We solve this with
         another hack: for context-dependent function "literals"
         like name#0 or position#0, the compiler actually generates a call on
         function-lookup("name", 0), which is an expression rather
         than a value, and which has to be evaluated at run-time.</p>
      <p>The SystemFunctionItem class implements
         an internal interface called FunctionItem, and as one might expect, a
         FunctionItem is an Item and therefore a Sequence: that is, it's a
         run-time value. Other subclasses of FunctionItem are used for calls
         to user defined functions, Java extension functions, or constructor
         functions. But they are only ever used for dynamic calls, never for
         static calls.</p>
      <p>Although there is no Function class,
         some functions are in fact represented as objects in their own right.
         The most important is UserFunction, which represents a user-written
         function in XSLT or XQuery. Another is InlineFunction (representing
         an anonymous inline function), and another is
         ExtensionFunctionDefinition, which represents a function whose
         implementation is provided in Java code: this is used both for
         user-written extension functions, and for many (but not all) vendor
         supplied extension functions in the Saxon namespace. But these
         classes have nothing in common with each other, there is no common
         superclass. This has the consequence that not only is there one set
         of machinery for static function calls and another quite different
         set for dynamic calls, but that in each case, there are many
         different flavours depending on what kind of function you happen to
         be calling.</p>
      <p>Getting this right involves a cleaner
         data model. As always, a clean data model leads to cleanly structured
         code, and the data model should be designed to accurately reflect the
         specification, not for the convenience of the implementation. The
         specification says we have two objects of interest, a function, and a
         function call. Quite rightly, the spec no longer uses the term
         "function item" as something distinct from the function: a
         function is an item. There's also something called the "function
         implementation" which we should recognize, because two functions
         may share an implementation. For example, the expression name#0
         returns a different function each time it is evaluated: these
         functions differ in the data they hold (a snapshot of the dynamic
         context), but they share the same implementation.</p>
      <p>We should be trying to move towards a
         structure where we have a hierarchy of subclasses of Function (for
         system functions, constructor functions, user functions, Java
         extension functions, etc); where the Function is an Item; where a
         Function may reference a FunctionImplementation to provide for
         sharing; and where a FunctionCall is as far as possible independent
         of what kind of function it is calling, but simply has two flavours
         for static function calls and dynamic function calls.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see how close
         we can get to that situation.</p>
