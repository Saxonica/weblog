      <p>As explained in my previous post, the NamePool in Saxon is a potential problem for
         scaleability, both because access can cause contention, and also because it has serious
         limits on the number of names it can hold: there's a maximum of one million QNames,
         and performance starts getting seriously bad long before this limit is reached.
         </p>
      <p>
         Essentially, the old NamePool is a home-grown hash table. It uses a fixed number of
         buckets (1024), and when hash collisions occur, the chains of hash duplicates are
         searched serially. The fact that the number of buckets is fixed, and entries are only
         added to the end of a chain, is what makes it (reasonably) safe for read access to
         the pool to occur without locking.
         </p>
      <p>
         One thing I have been doing over a period of time is to reduce the amount of unnecessary
         use of the NamePool. Most recently I've changed the implementation of the schema component
         model so that references from one schema component to another are no longer implemented
         using NamePool fingerprints. But this is peripheral: the core usage of the NamePool
         for comparing names in a query against names in a source document will always remain
         the dominant usage, and we need to make this scaleable as parallelism increases.
         </p>
      <p>
         Today I've been exploring an alternative design for the NamePool (and some variations
         on the implementation of the design). The new design has at its core two Java ConcurrentHashMaps,
         one from QNames to fingerprints, and one from fingerprints to QNames. The ConcurrentHashMap,
         which was introduced in Java 5, doesn't just offer safe multi-threaded access, it
         also offers very low contention: it uses fine-grained locking to ensure that multiple
         writers, and any number of readers, can access the data structure simulaneously.
         </p>
      <p>
         Using two maps, one of which is the inverse of the other, at first seemed a problem.
         How can we ensure that the two maps are consistent with each other, without updating
         both under an exclusive lock, which would negate all the benefits? The answer is that
         we can't completely, but we can get close enough.
         </p>
      <p>
         The logic is like this:
         </p>
      <pre><strong>private final </strong>ConcurrentHashMap&lt;StructuredQName, Integer&gt; <strong>qNameToInteger </strong>= <strong>new </strong>ConcurrentHashMap&lt;StructuredQName, Integer&gt;(1000);
<strong>private final </strong>ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, StructuredQName&gt; <strong>integerToQName </strong>= <strong>new </strong>ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, StructuredQName&gt;(1000);
<strong>private </strong>AtomicInteger <strong>unique </strong>= <strong>new </strong>AtomicInteger();

// Allocate fingerprint to QName

Integer existing = <strong>qNameToInteger</strong>.get(qName);
<strong>if</strong> (existing != <strong>null</strong>) {
    <strong>return</strong> existing;
}
Integer next = <strong>unique</strong>.getAndIncrement();
existing = <strong>qNameToInteger</strong>.putIfAbsent(qName, next);
<strong>if </strong>(existing == <strong>null</strong>) {
    <strong>integerToQName</strong>.put(next, qName);
    <strong>return</strong> next;
} <strong>else</strong> {
    <strong>return</strong> existing;
}</pre>
      <p>Now, there are several things slightly unsafe about this. We might find that the QName
         doesn't exist in the map on our first look, but by the time we get to the "putIfAbsent"
         call, someone else has added it. The worst that happens here is that we've used up
         an integer from the "unique" sequence unnecessarily. Also, someone else doing concurrent
         read access might see the NamePool in a state where one map has been updated and the
         other hasn't. But I believe this doesn't matter: clients aren't going to look for
         a fingerprint in the map unless they have good reason to believe that fingerprint
         exists, and it's highly implausible that this knowledge comes from a different thread
         that has only just added the fingerprint to the map.
         </p>
      <p>There's another ConcurrentHashMap involved as well, which is a map from URIs to lists
         of prefixes used in conjunction with that URI. I won't go into that detail.</p>
      <p>The external interface to the NamePool doesn't change at all by this redesign. We
         still use 20-bit fingerprints plus 10-bit prefix codes, so we still have the limit
         of a million distinct names. But performance no longer degrades when we get close
         to that limit; and the limit is no longer quite so hard-coded.</p>
      <p>My first attempt at measuring the performance of this found the expected benefits
         in scalability as the concurrency increases and as the size of the vocabulary increases,
         but the performance under more normal conditions was worse than the existing design:
         execution time of 5s versus 3s for executing 100,000 cycles each of which performed
         an addition (from a pool of 10,000 distinct names so 90% of the additions were already
         present) followed by 20 retrievals.</p>
      <p>I suspected that the performance degradation was caused by the need to update two
         maps, whereas the existing design only uses one (it's cleverly done so that the fingerprint
         generated for a QName is closely related to its hash key, which enables us to use
         the fingerprint to navigate back into the hash table to reconstruct the original QName).</p>
      <p>But it turned out that the cause was somewhere else. The old NamePool design was hashing
         QNames by considering only the local part of the name and ignoring the namespace URI,
         whereas the new design was computing a hash based on both the local name and the URI.
         Because URIs are often rather long, computing the hash code is expensive, and in this
         case it adds very little value: it's unusual for the same local name to be associated
         with more than one URI, and when it happens, the hash table is perfectly able to cope
         with the collision. By changing the hashing on QName objects to consider only the
         local name, the costs for the new design came down slightly below the current implementation
         (about 10% better, not enough to be noticeable).</p>
      <p>So I feel comfortable putting this into production. There are a dozen test cases failing
         (out of 20,000) which I need to sort out first, but it all looks very promising.</p>
