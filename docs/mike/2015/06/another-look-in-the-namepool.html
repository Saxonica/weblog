      <p>I've been looking again at the
         implementation of some of the parallel processing features in Saxon
         (see my <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/papers/xmlprague-2015mhk.pdf">XMLPrague 2015 paper</a>) and at how best to make use of the
         facilities in the Java platform to support them. In the course of
         this I've been studying Brian Goetz's excellent book Java Concurrency
         in Practice, which although dated, is still probably the best text
         available on the subject; and the fact that it only takes you up to
         Java 6 is an advantage in our case, because we still want Saxon to
         run on Java 6.</p>
      <p>Reading the book has made me think
         again about the venerable design of Saxon's NamePool, which is the
         oldest thing in the product where multithreading is relevant. The
         NamePool is basically a shared data structure holding QNames.</p>
      <p>The design of the NamePool hasn't
         changed much over the years. On the whole it works well, but there
         are a number of limitations:</p>
      <p>
         
         
         
         <ul>
            <li>
               
               
               <p>Updating the NamePool requires an
                  exclusive lock, and on occasions there has been heavy contention on
                  that lock, which reduces the effectiveness of running more threads.</p>
               </li>
            <li>
               
               
               <p>We read the NamePool without
                  acquiring a lock. All the textbooks say that's bad practice because
                  of the risk of subtle bugs. We've been using this design for over a
                  dozen years without a single of these subtle bugs coming to the
                  surface, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. It's very hard to
                  prove that the design is thread-safe, and it might only take an
                  unusual JVM, or an unusual hardware architecture, or a massively
                  parallel application, or pathological data (such as a local name
                  that appears in hundreds of namespaces) for a bug to suddenly
                  appear: which would be a serious embarassment.</p>
               </li>
            <li>
               
               
               <p>The fact that we read the NamePool
                  with no lock means that the data structure itself is very
                  conservative. We use a fixed number of hash buckets (1024), and a
                  chain of names within each bucket. We only ever append to the end of
                  such a chain. If the vocabulary is large, the chains can become
                  long, and searching then takes time proportional to the length of
                  the chains. Any attempt to change the number of buckets on the fly
                  is out of the question so long as we have non-locking readers. So
                  performance degrades with large vocabularies.</p>
               </li>
            <li>
               
               
               <p>We've got a problem coming up with
                  XSLT 3.0 packages. We want packages to be independently compiled,
                  and we want them to be distributed. That means we can't bind names
                  to fingerprints during package construction, because the package
                  will have to run with different namepools at run-time. We can
                  probably solve this problem by doing the binding of names at package
                  "load" or "link" time; but it's a change of
                  approach and that invites a rethink about how the NamePool works.</p>
               </li>
         </ul>
         
         </p>
      <p>Although the NamePool design hasn't
         changed much over the years, we've changed the way it is used: which
         essentially means, we use it less. Some while ago we stopped using
         the NamePool for things such as variable names and function names: it
         is now used only for element names, attribute names, and type names.
         Around Saxon 9.4 we changed the Receiver interface (Saxon's
         ubiquitous interface for passing push-mode events down a pipeline) so
         that element and attribute names were represented by a NodeName
         object instead of an integer fingerprint. The NodeName can hold a
         name either in string form or as an integer code, or both, so this
         change meant that we didn't have to allocate a NamePool fingerprint
         just to pass events down this pipeline, which in turn meant that we
         didn't have to allocate fingerprints to constructed elements and
         attributes that were going to be immediately serialized. We also
         stopped using the NamePool to allocate codes to (prefix, uri) pairs
         representing namespace bindings.</p>
      <p>These changes have been pretty
         effective and it's a while since we have seen a workload suffer from
         NamePool contention. However, we want to increase the level of
         parallelism that Saxon can support, and the NamePool remains a
         potential pinch point.</p>
      <p>There are a number of things we can do
         that would make a difference. We could for example use a Java
         <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-util-concurrent/readwritelock.html">ReadWriteLock</a>&nbsp;to allow either a single writer or multiple readers; this would allow
         us to introduce operations such as reconfiguring the hash table as
         the size of the vocabulary increases, without increasing contention
         because of the high frequency of read access.</p>
      <p>But let's first try and remind
         ourselves what the NamePool is actually for. It is there, first and
         foremost, to allow fast run-time testing of whether a particular node satisfies a
         NameTest. Because we use the same NamePool when constructing a source
         tree and when compiling a stylesheet or query, the node on the tree
         and the NameTest in the compiled code both know the integer fingerprint of
         the name, and testing the node against the NameTest therefore reduces
         to a fast integer comparison. This is undoubtedly far faster than
         doing a string comparison, especially one involving long URIs.</p>
      <p>If that was the only thing we used the
         NamePool for, then we would only need a single method,
         <b>allocateFingerprint(namespace, localName)</b>. What are all the other
         methods there for?</p>
      <p>Well, firstly, the NamePool knows the
         mapping of fingerprints to names, so we have read-only get methods to
         get the fingerprint corresponding to a name, or the name
         corresponding to a fingerprint. These are a convenience, but it seems
         that they are not essential. The client code that calls the NamePool
         to allocate a fingerprint to a name could retain the mapping
         somewhere else, so that there is no need to go back to a shared
         NamePool to rediscover what is already known.</p>
      <p>The most obvious case where this
         happens is with the TinyTree. The TinyTree holds the names of
         elements and attributes as fingerprints, not as strings, so
         operations like the XPath <b>local-name()</b> and <b>namespace-uri()</b> functions
         get the fingerprint from the TinyTree and then call on the NamePool
         to translate this back to a string. We could avoid this by keeping a
         map from integers to strings within the TinyTree itself. This could
         potentially have other benefits: we could make fewer calls on the
         NamePool to allocate fingerprints during tree construction; and
         retargeting a TinyTree to work with a different NamePool would be
         easier.</p>
      <p>Secondly, there's a lot of code in the
         NamePool to manage prefixes. This isn't needed for the core function
         of matching a node against a NameTest, since that operation ignores
         namespace prefixes. The detail here is that when we call
         <b>NamePool.allocate()</b>, we actually supply prefix, uri, and local-name,
         and we get back a 32-bit <b>nameCode</b> which uniquely represents this
         triple; the bottom 20 bits uniquely represent the local-name/uri
         pair, and it is these 20 bits (called the <b>fingerprint</b>) that are used
         in QName comparisons. The purpose of this exercise has nothing to do
         with making name comparisons faster; rather it is mainly concerned
         with saving space in the TinyTree. By packing the prefix information
         into the same integer as the local-name and URI, we save a few useful
         bits. But there are other ways of doing this without involving the
         NamePool; we could use the same few bits to index into a table of
         prefixes that is local to the TinyTree itself. There are of course a
         few complications; one of the benefits of the NamePool knowing about
         prefixes is that it can provide a service of suggesting a prefix to
         use with a given URI when the system is required to invent one: users
         like it when the prefix that emerges is one that has previously been
         associated with that URI by a human being. But there are probably
         less expensive ways of achieving this.</p>
      <p>Let's suppose that we reduced the
         functionality of the NamePool to a single method, <b>allocate(QName)&nbsp;→&nbsp;int</b>.
         How would we then implement it to minimize contention? A simple
         and safe implementation might be</p>
      <pre>HashMap&lt;QName, Integer&gt; map;
int next = 0;

public synchronized int allocate(QName q) {
       Integer n = map.get(q);
       if (n == null) {
              int m = ++next;
              map.put(q, m);
              return m;
       } else {
              return n;
       }
}</pre>
      <p>This still serializes all allocate
         operations, whether or not a new fingerprint is allocated. We can
         almost certainly do better by taking advantage of Java's concurrent
         collection classes, though it's not immediately obvious what the best
         way of doing it is. But in any case, if we can achieve this then
         we've reduced the NamePool to something much simpler than it is
         today, so optimization becomes a lot easier. It's worth noting that
         the above implementation still gives us the possibility to discover
         the fingerprint for a known QName, but not to (efficiently) get the
         QName for a known fingerprint.</p>
      <p>To get here, we need to start doing two
         things:</p>
      <p>(a) get prefixes out of the NamePool,
         and handle them some other way.</p>
      <p>(b) stop using the NamePool to discover
         the name associated with a known fingerprint.</p>
      <p>After that, redesign becomes relatively
         straightforward.</p>
