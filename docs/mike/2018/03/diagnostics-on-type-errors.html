      <p>Providing good diagnostics for programming errors has always been a high priority
         in Saxon, second only to conformance with the W3C specifications. One important area
         of diagnostics is reporting on type errors: that is, cases where a particular context
         requires a value of a given type, and the supplied value is the wrong type. A classic
         example would be providing a string as the first argument to format-date(), which
         requires an xs:date to be supplied.
         </p>
      <p>
         Of course, the more programmers follow the discipline of declaring the expected types
         of function parameters and variables, the more helpful the compiler can be in diagnosing
         programming errors caused by supplying the wrong type of value.<br>
         Type errors can be detected statically or dynamically. Saxon uses "optimistic type
         checking".&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         At compile time, it a value of type R is required in a particular context, and the
         expression appearing in that context is E, then the compiler attempts to infer the
         static type of expression E: call this S. Sometimes this is straightforward, for example
         if E is a call on the node-name() function, then it knows that S is xs:QName. In other
         case the compiler has to be smarter: for example it knows that the static type of
         a call on remove() is the same as the static type of the first argument, with an adjustment
         to the occurrence indicator.
         
         </p>
      <p>
         Optimistic type checking reports an error at compile time only if there is nothing
         in common between the required type R and the inferred static type of E: that is,
         if there is no overlap between the set of instances of the two types. That would mean
         that a run-time failure is inevitable (assuming the code actually gets executed),
         and the W3C specifications allow early reporting of such an error.
         </p>
      <p>
         There's another interesting case where the types overlap only to the extent that both
         allow an empty sequence: for example if the required type is (xs:string*) and the
         supplied type is (xs:integer*). That's almost certainly an error, but W3C doesn't
         allow an error to be reported here because there is a faint chance that execution
         could succeed. So Saxon reports this as a warning. With maps and arrays, incidentally,
         there are analogous situations where the only overlap is an empty map or array, but
         Saxon isn't yet handling that case specially.
         </p>
      <p>
         If the types aren't completely disjoint, there are two other possibilities: the required
         type R might subsume the supplied type S, meaning that no run-time type checking is
         needed because the call will always succeed. The other possibility is that the types
         overlap: evaluating the supplied expression E might or might not produce a value that
         matches the required type R. In this case Saxon generates code to perform run-time
         type checking. (This is one reason why declaring the types of parameters and variables
         is such good practice: the code runs faster because there is no unnecessary run-time
         checking.)
         </p>
      <p>
         Until recently, the error message for a type error takes the form:
         </p>
      <p>
         Required item type of CCC is RRR; supplied value has item type SSS
         </p>
      <p>
         For example:
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>Required item type of first argument to format-date() is xs:date; supplied value has
            item type xs:string</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         which works pretty well in most cases. However, I'm finding that as I write more complex
         code involving maps and arrays, it's no longer good enough. The problem is that as
         the types become more complex, simply giving the required and actual types isn't enough
         to make it clear why they are incompatible. You end up with messages like this one:
         </p>
      <p>
         
         <b>Required item type of first argument of local:x() is map(xs:integer, xs:date);&nbsp;</b><b>supplied value has item type map(xs:anyAtomicType, xs:date).</b>
         
         </p>
      <p>
         where an expert user can probably work out that the problem is that the supplied map
         contains an entry whose key is not an integer; but it doesn't exactly point clearly
         to the source of the problem.
         </p>
      <p>
         The problem comes to a head particularly when tuple types are used (see <a href="/mike/2016/09/tuple-types-and-type-aliases.html">here</a>). If the required type is a tuple type, reporting the supplied type as a map type
         is particularly unhelpful.
         </p>
      <p>
         I'm therefore changing the approach: instead of reporting on the supplied type of
         the value (or the inferred type of the expression, in the case of static errors),
         I'm reporting an explanation of why it doesn't match. Here's the new version of the
         message:
         </p>
      <p>
         
         <b>The required item type of the first argument of local:x() is map(xs:integer,&nbsp;</b><b>xs:date); the supplied value map{xs:date("2018-03-16Z"):5, "x":3} does not match.
            The map&nbsp;</b><b>contains a key (xs:date("2018-03-16Z")) of type xs:date that is not an instance of
            the&nbsp;</b><b>required type xs:integer.</b>
         
         </p>
      <p>
         So firstly, I'm outputting the actual value, or an abbreviated form of it, rather
         than just its type (that only works, of course, for run-time errors). And secondly,
         I'm highlighting how the type-checker worked out that the value doesn't match the
         required type: it's saying explicitly which rule was broken.
         </p>
      <p>
         (Another minor change you can see here is that I'm making more effort to write complete
         English sentences.)
         </p>
      <p>
         This doesn't just benefit the new map and array types, you can also see the effect
         with node types. For example, if the required type is document-node(element(foo)),
         you might see the message:
         </p>
      <p>
         
         <b>The required item type of the first argument of local:x() is&nbsp;</b><b>document-node(element(Q{}foo)); the supplied value doc() does not match. The supplied&nbsp;</b><b>document node has an element child (&lt;bar&gt;) that does not satisfy the element test.
            The&nbsp;</b><b>node has the wrong name.</b>
         
         </p>
      <p>
         Another change I'm making is to distribute type-checking into a sequence constructor.
         At present, if a function is defined to return (say) a list of element nodes, and
         the function body contains a sequence of a dozen instructions, one of which returns
         a text node, you get a message saying that the type of the function result is wrong,
         but it doesn't pinpoint exactly why. By distributing the type checking (applying the
         principle that if the function must return element nodes, then each of the instructions
         must return element nodes) we can (a) identify the instruction in error much more
         precisely, and (b) avoid the run-time cost of checking the results of those instructions
         that we know statically are OK.
         </p>
      <p>
         Interestingly, all these changes were stimulated by my own recent experience in writing
         a complex stylesheet. I described the plans for this <a href="/mike/2018/02/could-we-write-an-xsd-schema-processor-in-xslt.html">here</a> and the coding has now been completed (I'll report on the outcome later). It's a
         classic case of dogfood: if you use your own products in anger, you find ways of improving
         them that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise, and that users wouldn't have suggested
         because they don't know what's possible.
