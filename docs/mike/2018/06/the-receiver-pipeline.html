      <p>A significant feature of the internal architecture of Saxon is the <b style="font-size: 1em;">Receiver</b> pipeline. A receiver is an object that (rather like a SAX ContentHandler) is called
         with a sequence of events such as <i style="font-size: 1em;">startElement()</i>, <i style="font-size: 1em;">characters()</i>, and<i style="font-size: 1em;"> endElement()</i>; it typically does some processing on these events and then calls similar events
         on the next Receiver in the pipeline. The mechanism is efficient, because it avoids
         building a tree in memory, and because it allows much of the conditional logic of
         the processing (for example, whether or not to validate the document) to be executed
         at the time the pipeline is constructed, rather than with conditional code executed
         for every event that occurs.</p>
      <p>Receiver pipelines are used throughout Saxon: from doing whitespace stripping on the
         source document, to serialization of the result tree. The schema validator is implemented
         as a receiver pipeline, as are operations such as namespace fixup.</p>
      <p>But despite the elegance of the design, there have been some perennial problems with
         the implementation. For example, there are variations on exactly what input different
         implementations of Receiver will accept: some for example require an <i>open()</i> event while others don't; some accept entire element or document nodes in an <i>append()</i> event while others don't. This limits the ability to construct a pipeline using arbitrary
         combinations of Receivers, and worse, it's very hard to establish exactly what the
         permitted combinations are.</p>
      <p>This has come to a head recently in trying to get some of the new features in XSLT
         3.0 and XQuery 3.1 working reliably and robustly. The straw that broke the camel's
         back was the innocent-seeming <b>item-separator</b> serialization property. The item-separator is used while doing "sequence normalization"
         as the first stage of serialization; and the problem was that we didn't really do
         sequence normalization as a separate step in the processing. The obvious symptom that
         there are design problems here has been that whenever we get all the XQuery tests
         working, we find we've broken XSLT; and then when we get all the XSLT tests working,
         we find XQuery is now failing.</p>
      <p>The model according to the specs is that the transformation or query engine produces
         "raw" results (which can be any sequence of items), and this is then input to the
         serialization process (or possibly just to sequence normalization, which wraps the
         results in a document node and then delivers the document). But although Saxon could
         deliver raw results from an XQuery running in "pull" mode (the <i>XQueryEvaluator.iterate()</i> method) we never really had the capability to produce raw output in push mode: the
         push code did sequence normalization within the query/transformation logic, rather
         than leaving it to the serializer. That's for historic reasons, of course: with XSLT
         2.0, that's the way it was defined (the result of the transformation was always a
         document, with optional serialization).</p>
      <p>So the first principle to establish in sorting this out is: the interface between
         the query or transformation engine and the Destination (which may or may not be a
         Serializer) is a raw sequence, delivered over the Receiver interface.</p>
      <p>This requires a definition of exactly how a raw sequence is delivered over this interface:
         that is, what's the contract between the provider of the Receiver interface and the
         client (the sender of events). I've created that definition, and I've also written
         a Receiver implementation which validates that the sequence of events conforms to
         this definition; we can put this validation step into the pipeline when we feel it
         useful (for example, when running with assertions enabled). This exercise has revealed
         quite a few anomalies that should be fixed, for example cases where<i> endDocument()</i> is not being called before calling <i>close()</i>.</p>
      <p>There are three ways of delivering output from a query or transformation: raw output,
         document output (the result of sequence normalization), and serialized output. The
         next question that arises is, who decides which form is delivered. The simplest solution
         is: this is decided entirely at the API level, and does not depend on anything in
         the stylesheet or query. (This means that the XSLT build-tree attribute is ignored
         entirely.) In s9api terms, your choice of Destination object determines which kind
         of output you get. And at the implementation level, the Destination object always
         receives raw output; we don't want the transformation engine doing different things
         depending what kind of Destination has been supplied.</p>
      <p>The other related area that needed sorting out was the API interaction with<b> xsl:result-documen</b>t. We've always had the <i>OutputURIResolver</i> as a callback for determining what should happen to secondary result documents, but
         this is no longer fit for purpose. It was already a struggle to extend it to handle
         thread safety when the xsl:result-document instruction became asynchronous; further
         extending it to work with the s9api <i>Destination</i> framework has never been attempted because it just seemed too difficult. Having made
         the decision to introduce a dependency on Java 8 for the next major Saxon release,
         I think we can solve this at the API level with two enhancements:</p>
      <p>
         
         
         <ol>
            <li style="caret-color: black; color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard;">on <i>XsltTransformer</i> and <i>Xslt30Transformer</i>, a new method <i>setResultDocumentResolver()</i> which takes as argument an implementation of <i>Function&lt;URI, Destination&gt;</i> - that is a function that accepts an absolute URI as input, and returns a <i>Destination</i>;</li>
            <li>on <i>Destination</i>, a new method <i>onClose()</i> which takes as argument a <i>Consumer&lt;Destination&gt;</i>.</li>
         </ol>
         </p>
      <p>So when <b>xsl:result-document</b> is called, we construct the absolute URI and pass it to the registered result document
         resolver, and then use the returned <i>Destination</i> to write the result tree. On completion we call any <i>onClose()</i> handler registered with the <i>Destination</i>, which gives the application the opportunity to process the result document (for
         example, by writing it to a database).</p>
      <p>Of course, we have to work out how to implement this while retaining a level of backwards
         compatibility for applications using the existing <i>OutputURIResolver</i>.</p>
      <p>A tricky case with xsl:result-document has been where the href attribute is omitted
         or empty. I think the cleanest design here is to call the registered result document
         resolver passing the base output URI as argument, and use the returned Destination
         in the normal way. The application then has to sort out the fact that the original
         primary Destination for the transformation is not actually used.</p>
      <p>Yet another complication in the design is the rule in XSLT that when <b>xsl:result-document</b> requests schema validation of the output, schema validation is done after sequence
         normalization and before serialization. This is pretty ugly from a specification point
         of view: the serialization spec defines serialization as a 6-step process of which
         sequence normalization is the first; the XSLT spec really has no business inserting
         an additional step in the middle of this process. When the specification is ugly,
         the implementation usually ends up being ugly too, and we have to find some way for
         the transformation engine to inject a validation step into the middle of the pipeline
         implemented by the Destination, which ought by rights to be completely encapsulated.</p>
      <p>Standing back from all this, unlike some refactoring exercises, in this case the basic
         design of the code proved to be sound, but it needed reinforcement to make the implementation
         more robust. It needed a clear definition and enforcement of the contract implied
         by the Receiver interface; it needed a clear separation of concerns between the transformation/query
         engine and the Destination processing; and it needed a clean API to control it all.</p>
