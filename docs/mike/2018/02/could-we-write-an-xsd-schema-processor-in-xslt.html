      <p>Many computing platforms are not
         well-served by up to date XML technology, and in consequence Saxonica
         has been slowly increasing its coverage of the major platforms:
         extending from Java to .NET, C++, PHP, Javascript using a variety of
         technical approaches. This makes it desirable to implement as much as
         possible using portable languages, and if we want to minimize our
         dependence on third-party technologies (IKVMC, for example, is now
         effectively unsupported) we should be writing in our own languages,
         notably XSLT.</p>
      <p>This note therefore asks the question,
         could one write an XSD Schema 1.1 processor in XSLT?</p>
      <p>In fact a schema processor has two
         parts, compile time (compiling schema documents into the schema
         component model and SCM) and run-time (validating an instance
         document using the SCM).
         </p>
      <p>The first part, compiling, seems to
         pose no intrinsic difficulty. Some of the rules and constraints that
         need to be enforced are fairly convoluted, but the only really tricky
         part is compiling grammars into finite-state-machines, and checking
         grammars (or the resulting finite-state-machine) for conformance with
         rules such as the Unique Particle Attribution constraint. But since
         we already have a tool (written in Java) for compiling schemas into
         an XML-based SCM file, and since it wouldn't really inconvenience
         users too much for this tool to be invoked via an HTTP interface, the
         priority for a portable implementation is really the run-time part of
         the processor rather than the compile-time part. (Note that this means ignoring xsi:schemaLocation,
         since that effectively causes the run-time validator to invoke the schema compiler.)</p>
      <p>There are two ways one could envisage
         implementing the run-time part in XSLT: either with a universal
         stylesheet that takes the SCM and the instance document as inputs, or
         by generating a custom XSLT stylesheet from the SCM, rather as is
         done with Schematron. For the moment I'll keep an open mind which of
         these two approaches is preferable.</p>
      <p>Ideally, the XSLT stylesheet would use
         streaming so the instance document being validated does not need to
         fit in memory. We'll bear this requirement in mind as we look at the
         detail.</p>
      <p>The XSLT code, of course, cannot rely
         on any services from a schema processor, so it cannot be
         schema-aware.</p>
      <p>Let's look at the main jobs the
         validator has to do.</p>
      <p><b>Validating strings against simple types</b></p>
      <p>Validating against a primitive type can
         be done simply using the XPath castable operator.</p>
      <p>Validating against a simple type
         derived by restriction involves checking the various facets. For the
         most part, the logic of each facet is easily expressed in XPath.
         There are a few exceptions:</p>
      <p>
         
         
         
         <ul>
            <li>
               
               
               <p>Patterns (regular expressions).
                  The XPath regular expression syntax is a superset of the XSD syntax.
                  To evaluate XSD regular expressions, we either need some kind of
                  extension to the XPath matches() function, or we need to translate
                  XSD regular expressions into XPath regular expressions. This
                  translation is probably not too difficult. It mainly involves
                  rejecting some disallowed constructs (such as back-references,
                  non-capturing groups, and reluctant quantifiers), and escaping "^"
                  and "$" with a backslash.</p>
               </li>
            <li>
               
               
               <p>Length facets for hexBinary and
                  base64Binary. Base646Binary can be cast to hexBinary, and the length
                  of the value in octets can be computed by converting to string and
                  dividing the string length by 2.</p>
               </li>
         </ul>
         
         </p>
      <p>Validating against a list type can be
         achieved by tokenizing, and testing each token against the item type.</p>
      <p>Validating against a union type can be
         achieved by validating against each member type (and also validing
         against any constraining facets defined at the level of the union
         itself).</p>
      <p><b>Validating elements against complex
            types</b></p>
      <p>The only difficult case here is complex
         content. It should be possible to achieve this by iterating over the
         child nodes using xsl:iterate, keeping the current state (in the FSM)
         as the value of the iteration parameter. On completion the element is
         valid if the state is a final state. As each element is processed, it
         needs to be checked against the state of its parent element's FSM,
         and in addition a new validator is established for validating its
         children. This is all streamable.</p>
      <p><b>Assertions and Conditional Type
            Assignment</b></p>
      <p>Evaluating XPath expressions can be
         achieved using xsl:evaluate. The main difficulty is setting up the
         node-tree to which xsl:evaluate is applied. This needs to be a copy
         of the original source subtree, to ensure that the assertion cannot
         stray outside the relevant subtree. Making this copy consumes the
         source subtree, which makes streaming tricky: however, the ordinary
         complex type validation can also happen on the copy, so I think
         streaming is possible.</p>
      <p><b>Identity constraints (unique, key,
            keyref)</b></p>
      <p>This is where streaming really gets
         quite tricky - especially given the complexity of the specification
         for those rare keyref cases where the key is defined on a different
         element from the corresponding keyref.</p>
      <p>The obvious XSLT mechanism here is
         accumulators. But accumulator rules are triggered by patterns, and
         defining the patterns that correspond to the elements involved in a
         key definition is tricky. For example if sections nest recursively, a
         uniqueness constraint might say that for every section, its child
         section elements must have unique @section-number attributes. A
         corresponding accumulator would have to maintain a stack of sections,
         with a map of section numbers at each level of the stack, and the
         accumulator rule for a section would need to check the section number
         of that section at the current level, and start a new level.</p>
      <p>A further complication is that there
         may be multiple (global and/or local) element declarations with the
         same name, with different unique / key / keyref constraints. Deciding
         which of these apply by means of XSLT pattern matching is certainly
         difficult and may be impossible.</p>
      <p>The multiple xs:field elements within a
         constraint do not have to match components of the key in document
         order, but a streamed implementation would still be possible using
         the map constructor, which allows multiple downward selections -
         provided that the xs:field selector expressions are themselves
         streamable, which I think is probably always the case.</p>
      <p>The problem of streamability could
         possibly be solved with some kind of dynamic pipelining. The "main"
         validation process, when it encounters a start tag, is able to
         establish which element declaration it belongs to, and could in
         principle spawn another transformation (processing the same input
         stream) for each key / unique constraint defined in that element
         declaration: a kind of dynamic xsl:fork.</p>
      <p>I think as a first cut it would
         probably be wise not to attempt streaming in the case of a schema
         that uses unique / key / keyref constraints. More specifically, if
         any element has such constraints, it can be deep-copied, and
         validation can then switch to the in-memory subtree rather than the
         original stream. After all, we have no immediate plans to implement
         streaming other than in the Java product, and that will inevitably
         make an XSLT-based schema processor on other platforms unstreamed
         anyway.</p>
      <p><b>Outcome of validation</b></p>
      <p>There are two main scenarios we should
         support: validity checking, and type annotation. With validity
         checking we want to report many invalidities in a single validation
         episode, and the main output is the validation report. With type
         annotation, the main output is a validated version of the instance
         document, and a single invalidity can cause the process to terminate
         with a dynamic error.</p>
      <p>It is not possible for a
         non-schema-aware stylesheet to add type annotations to the result
         tree without some kind of extensions. The XSLT language only allows
         type annotations to be created as the result of schema validation. So
         we will need an extension for this purpose: perhaps a
         saxon:type-annotation="QName" attribute on instructions
         such as xsl:element, xsl:copy, xsl:attribute.</p>
      <p>For reporting validation errors, it's
         important to report the location of the invalidity. This also
         requires extensions, such as saxon:line-number().</p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>I don't think there are any serious
         obstacles to writing a validation engine in XSLT. Making it
         streamable is harder, especially for integrity constraints. A couple
         of extensions are needed: the ability to add type annotations to the
         result tree, and the ability to get line numbers of nodes in the
         source.</p>
      <p>I still have an open mind about whether
         a universal stylesheet should be used, or a generated stylesheet for
         a particular schema.</p>
