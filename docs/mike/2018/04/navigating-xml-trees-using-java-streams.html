         <h2><b>Navigating XML trees using Java Streams</b></h2>
         
         
         </p>
      <p>For the next major Saxon release I am planning an extension to the s9api interface
         to exploit the facilities of Java 8 streams to allow powerful navigation of XDM trees:
         the idea is that navigation should be as easy as using XPath, but without the need
         to drop out of Java into a different programming language. To give a flavour, here
         is how you might select the elements within a document that have @class='hidden':</p>
      <p><code>doc.select(descendant(isElement())</code><br><code>&nbsp; &nbsp;.where(attribute("class").eq("hidden")))</code></p>
      <p>We'll see how that works in due course.</p>
      <h2>Why do we need it?</h2>
      <p>The combination of Java and XML is as powerful and ubiquitous today as it as been
         for nearly twenty years.
         Java has moved on considerably (notably, as far as this article is concerned, with
         the Java 8 Streams API),
         and the world of XML processing has also made great strides (we now have XSLT 3.0,
         XPath 3.1, and XQuery 3.1),
         but for some reason the two have not moved together. The bulk of Java programmers
         manipulating XML, if we can
         judge from the questions they ask on forums such as StackOverflow, are still using
         DOM interfaces, perhaps with
         a bit of XPath 1.0 thrown in.</p>
      <p>DOM shows its age. It was originally designed for HTML, with XML added as an afterthought,
         and XML namespaces
         thrown in as a subsequent bolt-on. Its data model predates the XML Infoset and the
         (XPath-2.0-defined) XDM model.
         It was designed as a cross-language API and so the designers deliberately eschewed
         the usual
         Java conventions and interfaces in areas such as the handling of collections and iterators,
         not to mention exceptions.
         It does everything its own way. As a navigational API it carries a lot of baggage
         because the underlying tree is assumed
         to be mutable. Many programmers only discover far too late that it's not even thread-safe
         (even when you confine yourself
         to retrieval-only operations).</p>
      <p>There are better APIs than DOM available (for example JDOM2 and XOM) but they're all
         ten years old and haven't caught up with the times. There's nothing in the Java world
         that compares with Linq for C# users, or ElementTree in Python.</p>
      <p>The alternative of calling out from Java to execute XPath or XQuery expressions has
         its own disadvantages. Any
         crossing of boundaries from one programming language to another involves data conversions
         and a loss of type safety.
         Embedding a sublanguage in the form of character strings within a host language (as
         with SQL and regular expressions)
         means that the host language compiler can't do any static syntax checking or type
         checking of the expressions in the
         sublanguage. Unless users go to some effort to avoid it, it's easy to find that the
         cost of compiling XPath expressions
         is incurred on each execution, rather than being incurred once and amortized. And
         the API for passing context from the
         host language to the sublanguage can be very messy. It doesn't have to be quite as
         messy as the JAXP interface used for
         invoking XPath from Java, but it still has to involve a fair bit of complexity.</p>
      <p>Of course, there's the alternative of not using Java (or other general-purpose programming
         languages) at all: you
         can write the whole application in XSLT or XQuery. Given the capability that XSLT
         3.0 and XQuery 3.1 have acquired, that's
         a real possibility far more often than most users realise. But it remains true that
         if only 10% of your application is
         concerned with processing XML input, and the rest is doing something more interesting,
         then writing the whole application
         in XQuery would probably be a poor choice.</p>
      <p>Other programming languages have developed better APIs. Javascript has JQuery, C#
         programmers have Linq,
         Scala programmers have something very similar, and PHP users have SimpleXML. These
         APIs
         all have the characteristic that they are much more deeply integrated into the host
         language, and in particular they exploit
         the host language primitives for manipulation of sequences through functional programming
         constructs, with a reasonable
         level of type safety given that the actual structure of the XML document is not statically
         known.</p>
      <p>That leads to the question of data binding interfaces: broadly, APIs that exploit
         static knowledge of the schema of the
         source document. Such APIs have their place, but I'm not going to consider them any
         further in this article. In my experience
         they can work well if the XML schema is very simple and very stable. If the schema
         is complex or changing, data binding
         can be a disaster.</p>
      <p>
         
         
         
         
         <section>
            
            
            
            <h2><b>The Java 8 Streams API</b></h2>
            
            
            
            <p>This is not the place for an extended tutorial on the new Streams API introduced in
               Java 8. If you haven't come across
               it, I suggest you find a good tutorial on the web and read it before you go any further.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Java Streams are quite unrelated to XSLT 3.0 streaming. Well, almost unrelated: they
               share the same high-level objectives
               of processing large collections of data in a declarative way, making maximum use of
               lazy evaluation to reduce memory use,
               and permitting parallel execution. But that's where the similarity ends. Perhaps the
               biggest difference is that Java 8 streams
               are designed to process linear data structures (sequences), whereas XSLT 3.0 streaming
               is designed to process trees.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>But just to summarise:</p>
            
            
            
            <ul>
               <li>Java 8 introduces a new interface, <code>Stream&lt;X&gt;</code>, representing a linear sequence of items of type <code>X</code></li>
               <li>Like iterators, streams are designed to be used once. Unlike iterators, they are manipulated
                  using functional operations,
                  most notably maps and filters, rather than being processed one item at a time. This
                  makes for less error-prone programming,
                  and allows parallel execution.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            
            <p>The functional nature of the Java 8 Streams API means it has much in common with the
               processing model of XPath. The basic thrust
               of the API design presented in this article is therefore to reproduce the primitives
               of the XPath processing model, re-expressing
               them in terms of the constructs provided by the Java 8 Streams API.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>If the design appears to borrow concepts from other APIs such as LINQ and Scala and
               SimpleXML, that's not actually because I have a deep familiarity
               with those APIs: in fact, I have never used them in anger, and I haven't attempted
               to copy anything across literally. Rather, any similarity is because
               the functional concepts of XPath processing map so cleanly to this approach.</p>

            <h2>The Basics of the Saxon s9api API</h2>
            
            
            
            <p>The Saxon product primarily exists to enable XSLT, XQuery, XPath, and XML Schema processing.
               Some years ago I decided that the standard
               APIs (JAXP and XQJ) for invoking such functionality were becoming unfit for purpose.
               They had grown haphazardly over the years, the various APIs
               didn't work well together, and they weren't being updated to exploit the newer versions
               of the W3C specifications. Some appalling design mistakes
               had been unleashed on the world, and the strict backwards compatibility policy of
               the JDK meant these could never be corrected. </p>
            
            
            
            <p>To take one horrid example: the
               <code>NamespaceContext</code> interface is used to pass a set of namespace bindings from a Java application to
               an XPath processor. To implement this
               interface, you need to implement three methods, of which the XPath processor will
               only ever use one (<code>getNamespaceURI(prefix)</code>). Yet
               at the same time, there is no way the XPath processor can extract the full set of
               bindings defined in the <code>NamespaceContext</code> and copy them
               into its own data structures.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>So I decided some years ago to introduce a proprietary alternative called <b>s9api</b> into the Saxon product (retaining JAXP support alongside), and it has been a considerable
               success, in that it has withstood the test of time rather well. The changes to XSLT
               transformation in 3.0 were sufficiently radical that I forked the
               <code>XsltTransformer</code> interface to create a 3.0 version, but apart from that it has been largely possible
               to add new features incrementally. That's partly
               because of a slightly less obsessive attitude to backwards compatibility: if I decide
               that something was a bad mistake, I'm prepared to change it.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Although s9api is primarily about invoking XSLT, XQuery, and XPath processing, it
               does include classes that represent objects in the XDM data model,
               and I will introduce these briefly because the new navigation API relies on these
               objects as its foundation. The table below lists the main classes.</p>
            
            
            
            <table>

                     <th>Description</th>
                     </tr>
                  </thead>
               
               
               
               <tbody>
                  
                  
                  
                  <tr>
                     
                     
                     
                     <td valign="top"><code>XdmValue</code></td>
                     
                     
                     
                     <td>Every value is the XDM model is a sequence of items. The <code>XdmValue</code> class is therefore
                        the top of the class hierarchy. Because it's a sequence, it implements <code>Iterable&lt;XdmItem&gt;</code>,
                        so you can use a Java <code>foreach</code> loop to process the items sequentially. In the latest version
                        I have used Java generics to add a type parameter, so <code>XdmValue&lt;XdmNode&gt;</code> is a sequence
                        of nodes, and <code>XdmValue&lt;XdmAtomicValue&gt;</code> is a sequence of atomic values. As well as
                        an <code>iterator()</code> method, it has an <code>itemAt()</code> method to get the <i>N</i>th item,
                        and a <code>size()</code> method to count the items.
                        Internally an <code>XdmValue</code> might exist as an actual sequence in memory, or as a "promise": sufficient
                        data to enable the items to be materialized when they are needed.</td>
                     </tr>

                        and also an <code>XdmValue</code> (of length one) in its own right. It's an abstract class, because every
                        item is actually something more specific (a node, an atomic value, a function). Some
                        of the methods
                        inherited from <code>XdmValue</code> become trivial (for example <code>size()</code> always returns 1).

                        subclass this for different kinds of node: that's mainly because XDM has deliberately
                        aimed at uniformity,
                        with the same accessors available for all node kinds. Many of the methods on <code>XdmNode</code>, such

                        <code>getNodeKind()</code>, are directly equivalent to accessors defined in the W3C XDM specification.
                        But in addition, <code>XdmNode</code> has a method <code>axisIterator</code> to navigate the tree
                        using any of the XPath axes, the result being returned as an iterator over the selected
                        nodes.</td>

                        I won't be saying much about these in this article, because I'm primarily concerned
                        with navigating
                        XML trees.</td>

            <h2>The new API: Steps and Predicates</h2>
            
            
            
            <p>The basic concept behind the new extensions to the s9api
               API is navigation using steps and predicates. I'll introduce
               these concepts briefly in this section, and then go on to
               give a more detailed exposition.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>The class <code>XdmValue&lt;T&gt;</code> acquires a new method:</p>
            
            
            
            <p><code>XdmStream select(Step step)</code></p>
            
            
            
            <p>The <code>Step</code> here is a function that takes an item of class <code>T</code> as its input, and returns a stream of items. If we consider a very simple <code>Step</code>, namely <code>child()</code>, this takes a node as input and returns a stream of nodes
               as its result. We can apply this step to an <code>XdmValue</code> consisting entirely of nodes, and it returns the concatenation of the streams
               of nodes obtained by applying the step to each node in the input value. This operation
               is equivalent to the "!" operator in XPath 3.0, or to the
               <code>flatMap()</code> method in many functional programming languages. It's not quite the same as the familiar
               "/" operator in XPath, because
               it doesn't eliminate duplicates or sort the result into document order. But for most
               purposes it does the same job.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>There's a class <code>net.sf.saxon.s9api.streams.Steps</code> containing static methods which provide commonly-used steps such
               as <code>child()</code>. In my examples, I'll assume
               that the Java application has <code>import net.sf.saxon.s9api.streams.Steps.*;</code> in its header, so it can use these fields and methods without further
               qualification.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>One of the steps defined by this class is <code>net.sf.saxon.s9api.streams.Steps.child()</code>: this step is a function which, given a node, returns its children. There are
               other similar steps for the other XPath axes. So you can find the children of a node
               <code>N</code> by writing <code>N.select(child())</code>.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>Any two steps <code>S</code> and <code>T</code>
               can be combined into a single composite step by writing <code>S.then(T)</code>: for example <code>Step grandchildren = child().then(child())</code> gives you
               a step which can be used in the expression <code>N.select(grandchildren)</code> to select all the grandchildren.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>The class <code>Step</code> inherits from the standard Java class <code>Function</code>, so it can be used more generally in any Java context where a
               <code>Function</code> is required.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p><code>Predicate&lt;T&gt;</code> is a standard Java 8 class: it defines a function that can be applied to an object
               of type <code>T</code> to return
               true or false. The class <code>net.sf.saxon.s9api.streams.Predicates</code>&nbsp;defines some standard predicates that are useful when processing XML. For example
               <code>isElement()</code>&nbsp;gives you a predicate that can be applied to any <code>XdmItem</code> to determine if it is an element node.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>Given a <code>Step</code> <code>A</code> and a <code>Predicate</code> <code>P</code>, the expression <code>A.where(P)</code> returns a new
               <code>Step</code> that filters the results of <code>A</code> to include only those items that satisfy the predicate <code>P</code>. So, for example,
               <code>child().where(isElement())</code> is a step that selects the element children of a node, so that <code>N.select(child().where(isElement()))</code>
               selects the element children of <code>N</code>. This is sufficiently common that we provide a shorthand: it can also be written
               
               <code>N.select(child(isElement()))</code>.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>The predicate <code>hasLocalName("foo")</code> matches nodes having a local name of "foo": so <code>N.select(child().where(hasLocalName("foo"))</code>
               selects the relevant children. Again this is so common that we provide a shorthand:
               <code>N.select(child("foo"))</code>. There is also a two argument version
               <code>child(ns, "foo")</code> which selects children with a given namespace URI and local name.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>Another useful predicate is <code>exists(step)</code> which tests whether the result of applying a given step returns at least one item.
               So, for example
               <code>N.select(child().where(exists(attribute("id"))))</code> returns those children of <code>N</code> that have an attribute named "id".</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>The result of the <code>select()</code> method is always a stream of items, so you can use methods from the Java Stream class
               such as filter() and flatMap() to process the result. Here are some of the standard
               things you can do
               with a stream of items in Java:</p>
            
            
            
            
            <ul>
               <li>You can get the results as an array: <code>N.select(child()).toArray()</code></li>
               <li>Or as a list: <code>N.select(child()).collect(Collectors.toList())</code></li>
               <li>You can apply a function to each item in the stream: <code>N.select(child()).forEach(System.err::println)</code></li>
               <li>You can get the first item in the stream: <code>N.select(child()).findFirst().get()</code></li>
            </ul>
            
            
            
            
            <p>However, Saxon methods such as <code>select()</code> always return a subclass of <code>Stream</code> called <code>XdmStream</code>, and this offers additional methods. For example:</p>
            
            
            
            
            <ul>
               <li>You can get the results as an <code>XdmValue</code>: <code>N.select(child()).asXdmValue()</code></li>
               <li>A more convenient way to get the results as a Java <code>List</code>: <code>N.select(child()).asList()</code></li>
               <li>If you know that the stream contains a single node (or nothing), you can get this
                  using the methods <code>asNode()</code>
                  or <code>asOptionalNode()</code></li>
               <li>Similarly, if you know that the stream contains a single atomic value (or nothing),
                  you can get this using the methods <code>asAtomic()</code> or <code>asOptionalAtomic()</code></li>
               <li>You can get the last item in the stream: <code>N.select(child("para")).last()</code></li>
            </ul>

               <h2><b>More about Steps</b></h2>
               
               
               
               <p>The actual definition of the <code>Step</code> class is:</p>
               
               
               
               
               <p><code>public abstract class Step&lt;T extends XdmItem&gt;
                     implements Function&lt;XdmItem, Stream&lt;? extends T&gt;&gt; </code></p>
               
               
               
               
               <p>What that means is that it's a function that any <code>XdmItem</code> as input, and delivers a stream of <code>U</code> items as its result (where <code>U</code> is <code>XdmItem</code>
                  or some possibly-different subclass). (I experimented by also parameterizing the class
                  on the type of items accepted, but that didn't work out well.)</p>
               
               
               
               
               <p>Because the types are defined, Java can make type inferences: for example it knows
                  that <code>N.select(child())</code> will return nodes
                  (because <code>child()</code> is a step that returns nodes).</p>
               
               
               
               
               <p>As a user of this API, you can define your own kinds of <code>Step</code> if you want to: but most of the time you will be able to do everything
                  you need with the standard Steps available from the class <code>net.sf.saxon.s9api.stream.Steps</code>. The standard steps include:</p>
               
               
               
               
               <ul>
                  <li>The axis steps <code>ancestor()</code>, <code>ancestor-or-self()</code>, <code>attribute()</code>, <code>child()</code>,
                     <code>descendant()</code>, <code>descendantOrSelf()</code>, <code>following()</code>, <code>followingSibling()</code>,
                     <code>namespace()</code>, <code>parent()</code>, <code>preceding()</code>, <code>precedingSibling()</code>,
                     <code>self()</code>.</li>
                  <li>For each axis, three filtered versions: for example <code>child("foo")</code> filters the axis to select elements by
                     local name (ignoring the namespace if any); <code>child(ns, local)</code> filters the axis to select elements by
                     namespace URI and local name, and <code>child(predicate)</code> filters the axis using an arbitrary predicate: this is
                     a shorthand for <code>child().where(predicate)</code>.</li>
                  <li>A composite step can be constructed using the method <code>step1.then(step2)</code>. This applies <code>step2</code>
                     to every item in the result of <code>step1</code>, retaining the order of results and flattening them into a single stream.</li>
                  <li>A filtered step can be constructed using the method <code>step1.where(predicate1)</code>. This selects those items in the
                     result of <code>step1</code> for which <code>predicate1</code> returns true.</li>
                  <li>A path with several steps can be constructed using a call such as<code>path(child(isElement()), attribute("id"))</code>. This returns a step whose effect is to return the <code>id</code> attributes of all the children of the target node.</li>
                  <li>If the steps are sufficiently simple, a path can also by written means of a simple
                     micro-syntax similar to XPath abbreviated steps. The previous example could also be
                     written <code>path("*", "@id")</code>. Again, this returns a step that can be used like any other step.
                     (In my own applications, I have found myself using this approach very extensively).</li>
                  <li>The step <code>atomize()</code> extracts the typed values of nodes in the input, following the rules in the XPath
                     specification. The result
                     is a stream of atomic values</li>
                  <li>The step <code>toString()</code> likewise extracts the string values, while <code>toNumber()</code> has the same effect as the
                     XPath <code>number()</code> function</li>
               </ul>
               
               
               
               
               <p>Last but not least, <code>xpath(path)</code> returns a <code>Step</code> that evaluates an XPath expression. For example,
                  <code>doc.select(xpath("//foo"))</code> has the same effect as <code>doc.select(descendant("foo"))</code>. A second argument
                  to the <code>xpath()</code> method may be used to supply a static context for the evaluation. Note that compilation
                  of the XPath expression
                  occurs while the step is being created, not while it is being evaluated; so if you
                  bind the result of <code>xpath("//foo")</code> to
                  a variable, then the expression can be evaluated repeatedly without recompilation.</p>

               <h2><b>More about Predicates</b></h2>
               
               
               
               <p>The <code>Predicate</code> class is a standard Java 8 interface: it is a function that takes any object as input,
                  and returns a boolean.
                  You can use any predicates you like with this API, but the class <code>net.sf.saxon.s9api.streams.Predicates</code> provides some implementations
                  of <code>Predicate</code> that are particularly useful when navigating XML documents. These include the following:</p>
               
               
               
               
               <ul>
                  <li><code>isElement()</code>, <code>isAttribute()</code>, <code>isText()</code>, <code>isComment()</code>,
                     <code>isDocument()</code>, <code>isProcessingInstruction()</code>, <code>isNamespace()</code> test that the item
                     is a node of a particular kind</li>
                  <li><code>hasName("ns", "local")</code>, <code>hasLocalName("n")</code>, and <code>hasNamespaceUri("ns")</code> make tests
                     against the name of the node</li>
                  <li><code>hasType(t)</code> tests the type of the item: for example <code>hasType(ItemType.DATE)</code> tests for
                     atomic values of type <code>xs:date</code></li>
                  <li><code>exists(step)</code> tests whether the result of applying the given step is a sequence containing at least
                     one item; conversely <code>empty(step)</code> tests whether the result of the step is empty. For example, <code>exists(CHILD)</code>
                     is true for a node that has children.</li>
                  <li><code>some(step, predicate)</code> tests whether at least one item selected by the step satisfies the given predicate.
                     For example,
                     <code>some(CHILD, IS_ELEMENT)</code> tests whether the item is a node with at least one element child. Similarly <code>every(step, predicate)</code>
                     tests whether the predicate is true for every item selected by the step.</li>
                  <li><code>eq(string)</code> tests whether the string value of the item is equal to the given string; while <code>eq(double)</code> does
                     a numeric comparison. A two-argument version <code>eq(step, string)</code> is shorthand for <code>some(step, eq(string))</code>.
                     For example, <code>descendant(eq(attribute("id"), "ABC"))</code> finds all descendant elements
                     having an "id" attribute equal to "ABC".</li>
                  <li>Java provides standard methods for combining predicates using <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>. For example
                     <code>isElement().and(eq("foo"))</code> is a predicate that tests whether an item is an element with string-value "foo".</li>
               </ul>

               <p>The fact that all this machinery is built on Java 8 streams and functions is something
                  that many users can safely ignore; they are essential foundations, but they are hidden
                  below the surface. At the same time, a user who understands that steps and predicates
                  are Java Functions, and that the result of the select() method is a Java Stream, can
                  take advantage of this knowledge.
                  
                  
                  </p>
               
               
               <p>
                  
                  
                  One of the key ideas that made this possible was the idea of subclassing <code>Stream</code> with <code>XdmStream</code>. This idea was shamelessly stolen from the open-source <strong>StreamEx</strong> library by Tagir Valeev (though no StreamEx code is actually used). Subclassing <code>Stream</code> enables additional methods to be provided to handle the results of the stream, avoiding
                  the need for clumsy calls on the generic <code>collect()</code> method. Another motivating factor here is to allow for early exit (short-circuit
                  evaluation) when a result can be delivered without reading the whole stream. Saxon
                  handles this by registering <code>onClose()</code> handlers with the stream pipeline, so that when the consumer of the stream calls
                  the <code>XdmStream.close()</code> method, the underlying supplier of data to the stream is notified that no more data
                  is needed.

               <p>This section provides some examples extracted from an actual program that uses s9api
                  interfaces and does a
                  mixture of Java navigation and XPath and XQuery processing
                  to extract data from an input document.</p>
               
               
               
               
               <p>First, some very simple examples. Constructs like this are not uncommon:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><code>XdmNode testInput = (XdmNode) xpath.evaluateSingle("test", testCase);</code></p>
               
               
               
               <p>This can be replaced with the much simpler and more efficient:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><code>XdmNode testInput = testCase.selectFirst(child("test"));</code></p>
               
               
               
               <p>Similarly, the slightly more complex expression:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><code>XdmNode principalPackage = (XdmNode) xpath.evaluateSingle("package[@role='principal']",
                     testInput);</code></p>
               
               
               
               <p>becomes:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><code>XdmNode principalPackage = testInput.selectFirst(child("package").where(eq(attribute("role"),
                     "principal"));</code></p>
               
               
               
               
               <p>A more complex example from the same application is this one:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><code>boolean definesError = xpath.evaluate("result//error[starts-with(@code, 'XTSE')]",
                     testCase).size() &gt; 0;
                     </code></p>
               
               
               
               <p>Note here how the processing is split between XPath code and Java code. This is also
                  using an XPath function for which we haven't provided a built-in
                  predicate in s9api. But that's no problem, because we can invoke Java methods as predicates.
                  So this becomes:</p>
               
               
               
               <pre><code>boolean definesError = testCase.selectFirst(child("result"), descendant("error").where(
                     some(attribute("code"), (XdmNode n) -&gt; n.getStringValue().startsWith("XTSE"))) != null;</code></pre>
               
               
               </section>
            
            </section>
