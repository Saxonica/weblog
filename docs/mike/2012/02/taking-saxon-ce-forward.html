         <p>The work we are doing on Saxon-CE (<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT" title="XSLT" rel="wikipedia">XSLT 2.0</a> on the 
            browser) received a very encouraging reception at XML Prague. Our 
            half-day tutorial/workshop was very well attended, and there was a lot 
            of useful feedback, and new ideas which we are hoping to incorporate. 
            Discussions in the corridors of the conference also demonstrated a lot 
            of interest. If you're not familiar with the current status, it's now on
            <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.techopedia.com/definition/5935/alpha-test" title="Alpha Test" rel="techopedia">beta release</a>, and we've been doing a lot of work that can be summed up 
            as taking it from the prototype we showed last year to an 
            industrial-strength product with stable interfaces, a range of 
            development and debugging and instrumentation tools, responsive 
            performance, and full cross-browser compatibility.</p>
         <p>There are a few technical things we need to do before the product is 
            finished. Providing a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" title="JavaScript" rel="wikipedia">Javascript</a> <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.techopedia.com/definition/24407/application-programming-interface-api" title="Application Programming Interface" rel="techopedia">API</a> is one; another is to provide 
            control over management of the browser <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar" title="Address bar" rel="wikipedia">URL bar</a> and history, so that 
            users can save bookmarks and use the back button in the way that they 
            expect; and we need to enable asynchronous fetching of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/xml-tools/" title="xml tools" rel="downloadcom">XML documents</a> 
            from the server to create <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" title="Ajax (programming)" rel="wikipedia">AJAX</a>-style applications (since the J stands 
            for Javascript, perhaps we should call it AXAX).</p>
         <p>We're also starting to plan the commercial side of shipping a 
            product. That includes pricing, the logistics of licensing and selling, 
            and some basic marketing. We're not going to give the product away: 
            there are too many good <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software" title="Computer software" rel="wikipedia">software products</a> that have stalled because the 
            value delivered to users wasn't flowing back to the developers to invest
            in the product. At the same time, giving software away free, within 
            limits, is by far the best way of establishing a presence in the market.</p>
         <p>Let me share my current thinking on pricing. I'm interested in 
            feedback, so let me know what you think: these are just current ideas, 
            so it might turn out quite different.</p>
         <p>Firstly, the software will be licensed by domain (the name of the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name" rel="wikipedia">web
               domain</a> on which it is deployed). We've already got that mechanism in 
            place in the beta. We're hoping it's simple, clear, and hassle-free. 
            We're not charging per developer, because that would be complicated and 
            because the cost isn't directly related to the value; and we're not 
            charging per end-user or per access, because that would be madness. 
            Perhaps for people who want to deploy on multiple domains - the IBMs of 
            this world - we will offer some kind of discount for domains after the 
            first.</p>
         <p>Secondly, we'll classify users into two groups: small and large. (Not
            "commercial" and "non-commercial" - that leaves far too many questions 
            of definition). A small user is an individual or company or organization
            with revenue less than $x per annum (let's say $1m for the sake of 
            argument), and a big user is anyone else. The entity whose revenue 
            matters is the legal owner of the domain for which the license is held, 
            which is nice because we can look that up; in many cases we can also 
            check the revenue from public information, so there's not too much room 
            for cheating.</p>
         <p>Finally, we'll give you a choice of getting a one-year license or a 
            permanent license. A one-year license will switch off at the end of the 
            year. We hope that's a painful enough prospect that people who are 
            taking the software seriously will choose to pay for a permanent 
            license, while leaving a low-cost option for those who aren't quite sure
            yet how much commitment they want to make.</p>
         <p>So that gives four prices, looking something like this (in GBP):    </p>

         <p>
            How do we tell if we have got this right? The prices look high by some 
            standards, low by others. I think the test whether the price is in the 
            right ballpark is that it is (a) less than the value users are getting 
            from the software, and (b) greater than the money we are spending on 
            developing it. On those criteria, it looks good to me, but I welcome 
            your views!</p>
