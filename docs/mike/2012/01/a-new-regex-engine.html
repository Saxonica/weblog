      <p>
         Welcome to the new blog site. I hope it meets expectations.
         </p>
      <p>I've been busy integrating a new regex engine into Saxon over the last week or so.
         </p>
      <p>
         Why?
         </p>
      <p>
         The current arrangement is that Saxon (using code written originally by James Clark)
         parses the regular expression supplied to functions like matches() and replace(),
         or to the XSD pattern facet, and translates it into a Java JDK regular expression.
         </p>
      <p>
         The disadvantages of this are (a) the process is inefficient, as the regular expression
         is effectively parsed twice (and the JDK regular expression that Saxon generates may
         be very long and complicated in some cases), (b) Saxon has little control over the
         details of evaluation, needed to achieve precise conformance to the XSD and XPath
         specs, (c) there are bugs in the JDK regex engine which Oracle appear to be in no
         hurry to fix.
         </p>
      <p>
         In Saxon 9.4 we've moved forward to Unicode 6.0 (the JDK is still on 3 point-something)
         and this compounds the problem, because the expansions of character classes such as
         \p{Lu} become increasingly long-winded.
         </p>
      <p>
         For Saxon-CE there is an added impetus. GWT doesn't support the Java regular expression
         API; instead it provides an interface to JavaScript regular expressions. We could
         have written yet another variant of the regex translator, including digging out the
         old version that targeted a regex engine with no support for non-BMP Unicode characters,
         but this didn't feel like an attractive option; it wasn't even easy to see how constructs
         such as XSD's subtraction operator ([A-Z-[aeiou]]) should be supported. It seemed
         a good time for Saxon to have its own regex engine.
         </p>
      <p>
         I looked at two candidates: JRegex and Apache Jakarta. On paper, JRegex looked a better
         option, but I found the code extremely obscure and badly documented. I did a preliminary
         integration of JRegex, but it crashed on some of the tests, and understanding the
         engine well enough to debug and fix these problems didn't look like being much fun.
         So I decided to go with Jakarta.
         </p>
      <p>
         Jakarta is not a particularly sophisticated regex engine, but it's easy to understand
         how it works and therefore easy to change it. It's also surprisingly small - not much
         bigger than the current JDK regex translator. I started by changing the front-end
         to handle the (slightly different) XSD and XPath dialects of regular expressions,
         which was straightforward enough, except perhaps for the rather subtle rules on how
         hyphens appearing within a character class (ie. between square brackets) are parsed,
         and how many digits get swallowed by a back-reference.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         The next change was to ensure that all Unicode codepoints (including surrogate pairs)
         are handled as single characters rather than pairs of 16-bit values. This didn't prove
         difficult, partly because the engine was already using an abstraction for character
         strings (although this was used only for the input string and not for the regex itself.)
         Then all character classes such as \p{Lu}, \i, and \c had to be implemented in terms
         of the Unicode 6.0 definitions - which wasn't hard, because the existing regex translator
         already understood these constructs.
         </p>
      <p>
         At this stage nearly all the tests ran successfully (and fortunately, there's a large
         suite of regression tests for both XSD and XQuery).
         </p>
      <p>
         Jakarta enforced a rule that in the construct (E)*, E must not be "nullable". For
         example, you aren't allowed to write (a?)*. That seems a reasonable restriction, but
         unfortunately there's no such limitation in the XSD or XPath specs, so I had to work
         out what to do with this construct. Simply removing the restriction meant that the
         matching engine would fail to terminate on these constructs (after all, every string
         contains an infinite number of consecutive empty sequences...) The pro-tem solution
         I've come up with, though I'm not 100% enamoured of it, is for the (*) operator to
         keep track of where it has been: if the same operation is applied at the same position
         in the input string more than once, the second attempt is deemed to be a no-match.
         (If anyone knows a better approach, let me know.)
         </p>
      <p>
         The final problem shown up by the tests was that matching long input strings had a
         tendency to cause a stack overflow. This is because the engine is using recursion
         to work its way through the string, this being the easy way to implement back-tracking.
         It's well known that backtracking isn't a brilliant approach to regex evaluation,
         especially for pathological cases, but unfortunately the kind of regexes in popular
         use (with substring capture and backreferences) aren't true "regular" expressions
         in the sense that the theorists use the term, and the better algorithms can only handle
         truly regular expressions. At this stage I felt some pragmatic improvements were more
         appropriate than a rewrite using a new algorithm, and it seems that all the test cases
         that were failing in this way were amenable to a simple optimization: if you can detect
         that (E*) must be followed by something that doesn't match E, then the evaluation
         of E* will never need to backtrack, and therefore it can be evaluated using iteration
         rather than recursion.
         </p>
      <p>
         It's now all running, both in "big" Saxon (-HE, -PE, -EE) and also in the client-side
         Saxon-CE engine. We haven't measured performance yet, but the results are unlikely
         to be surprising: initial compilation of regular expressions should be considerably
         faster; evaluation of simple regular expressions should be much the same, and evaluation
         of pathological regular expressions involving backtracking will probably be bad (as
         it already is in the JDK engine).
