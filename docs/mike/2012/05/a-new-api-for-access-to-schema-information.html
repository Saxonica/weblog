      <p><a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_XSLT" title="Saxon XSLT" rel="wikipedia">Saxon</a> for a while has had the ability to export the schema <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering" title="Component-based software engineering" rel="wikipedia">component model</a> as an <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" title="XML" rel="wikipedia">XML document</a>, making it accessible to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT" title="XSLT" rel="wikipedia">XSLT</a> and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/" title="XQuery" rel="homepage">XQuery</a> applications. Providing the information at this level is much easier to process because
         it represents the "compiled" schema rather than the raw schema documents; so there's
         no sensitivity to all the stylistic variations in the way users choose to write schemas.
         Nevertheless, it's not a particularly easy model to work with, partly because chasing
         all the references from one component to another isn't much fun.
         </p>
      <p>
         I've been experimenting today with a new interface that represents the schema components
         directly as a functional model.
         </p>
      <p>
         So saxon:schema() returns the "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema" title="XML schema" rel="wikipedia">Schema</a>" schema component as a function, and saxon:schema()('element declarations') gets
         all the element declarations, as a list of functions. If you want the element declaration
         with a particular name, that's
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>let $bookDecl := saxon:schema()('element declarations')[.('name') = 'BOOK']</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         which is likely to be sufficiently common that I propose to offer a short-cut.
         </p>
      <p>
         The properties of the element are then available, for example
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>$bookDecl('nillable')</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         tests whether the declaration is nillable, and
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>$bookDecl('abstract')</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         tests whether it is abstract.
         </p>
      <p>
         Many properties have values that are themselves schema components, also represented
         as functions. So to discover whether an element has element-only content you can test:
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>if ($bookDecl('type definition')('variety') = 'element-only') ...</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         All the schema components and property records are available as described in the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29" title="XML Schema (W3C)" rel="wikipedia">XSD</a> 1.1 specification, with a very few exceptions (hopefully temporary):
         </p>
      <p>
         (a) Saxon currently does not provide access to annotations (they are discarded at
         schema processing time)
         </p>
      <p>
         (b) One or two other properties are not fully implemented, for example, {context}
         and {fundamental facets}
         </p>
      <p>
         (c) The types available directly from the Schema do not include built-in types
         </p>
      <p>
         (d) Saxon represents multiple patterns and assertions of a simple type as multiple
         facet objects rather than a single facet object.
         </p>
      <p>
         (e) There's one property that's hard to represent directly in the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDM_%28display_manager%29" title="XDM (display manager)" rel="wikipedia">XDM</a> data model: the value of the enumeration facet is a sequence of sequences. So I'm
         currently exposing the enumeration values as string values rather than typed values.
         </p>
      <p>
         Every component has an additional property "class" which tells you what kind of schema
         component it is. This is particularly necessary for the components representing facets,
         where the class is the only way of telling, for example, whether you have a minInclusive
         or a maxExclusive facet.
         </p>
      <p>
         That's a lot of capability but I think there are one or two other things needed:
         </p>
      <p>
         (i) getting top-level global components by name. I think the best way to do this is
         a function <b>saxon:element-declaration()</b> that takes the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QName" title="QName" rel="wikipedia">QName</a> of the required component and returns the component directly; there will be one of
         these functions for each kind of component.
         </p>
      <p>
         (ii) a few other 'convenience' properties that short-circuit complex navigation of
         the component model. For example, starting with an element declaration, getting all
         the element declarations of its permitted children, without having to trawl your way
         through the complex type and its particles and terms and their substitution groups.
         I guess only experience of real applications will show what convenience functions
         are really needed.
         </p>
      <p>
         (iii) linking to this model from validated instances (a subset of the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSVI" title="PSVI" rel="wikipedia">PSVI</a> - initially perhaps just the ability to get from a node to the schema component representing
         its type annotation) and perhaps also from validation errors: if you use try/catch
         to catch a validation error, it would be nice if the error object gives access to
         the relevant schema component.
         </p>
      <p>
         Note that I haven't mentioned maps. The functions that implement schema components
         might be maps, or they might not. That's an implementation detail. One of the nice
         things about the XSLT 3.0 model for maps (already implemented in Saxon 9.4) is that
         maps are functions, so &nbsp;if an interface like this one is defined in terms of functions,
         it can use maps behind the scenes in the implementation, or not, as it pleases. In
         fact my current implementation isn't using maps, because that makes it easier to do
         a lazy implementation in which there is no underlying data structure other than the
         Java classes that are already there to implement the component model.
         </p>
      <p>
         One nice property of this API is that I can't see many obstacles to standardizing
         it so it's available in all XSLT and XQuery implementations. The main work, of defining
         the schema component model, has already been done in the XSD specs.&nbsp;
