      <p>I discovered yesterday that Saxon-CE isn't applying xsl:strip-space directives to
         input documents. &nbsp;An unfortunate bug: not that many users seem too bothered by it,
         but conformance is always important.
         </p>
      <p>
         A reminder: xsl:strip-space and xsl:preserve-space are designed to remove "ignorable"
         whitespace from the application's view. Because XML &nbsp;doesn't distinguish significant
         from insignificant whitespace (a bad design mistake), this can only be done under
         program control. The idea is to present the application (the stylesheet) with a view
         of the input tree in which the insignificant whitespace does not appear, and the xsl:strip-space
         and xsl:preserve-space directives allow the stylesheet author to say which whitespace
         is considered significant.<br>
         How to fix the bug? Server-side Saxon (what I am starting to call "Big Saxon") traditionally
         provides two mechanisms: either it wraps the supplied DOM in a wrapping layer that
         hides the offending whitespace text nodes, or it bulk-copies the supplied DOM to an
         internal tree structure in which the whitespace is not copied across. Both methods
         have disadvantages. The "wrapping" approach imposes a significant extra cost on navigation
         of the tree (the cost is higher than it might appear, because whitespace stripping
         also has to take account of xml:space attributes in the document, which means a lot
         of searching for attributes-of-ancestors). The bulk-copy approach imposes a significant
         start-up cost to the transformation, often larger than the cost of doing the real
         transformation, and the cost is particularly high when processing large input documents
         because it doubles the memory requirement.
         
         </p>
      <p>
         I'm considering using a third approach: in-situ modification of the supplied DOM.
         For Big Saxon, I have tended to treat this option as unthinkable: you don't muck with
         the user's data in this way. The same DOM, after all, might be input to multiple stylesheets,
         perhaps concurrently (though DOM is not thread-safe so this is a bad idea....) and
         they might have different space-stripping directives. A Java application might pass
         the DOM to an XSLT stylesheet to do some processing, but might want to continue operating
         on the same DOM afterwards.
         </p>
      <p>
         In Saxon-CE, however, these considerations hardly apply. In the vast majority of cases
         the DOM is built solely in order to act as XSLT input. Unlike Big Saxon, where one
         can assume that if users supply a DOM they are doing so by choice, with Saxon-CE there
         is no alternative: all input XML arrives this way.
         </p>
      <p>
         In-situ clean-up of the input DOM has other attractions; it can be used to solve the
         other two big problems with DOM processing (both arising from a mismatch between the
         DOM model and the XDM model): adjacent text nodes, and namespaces. The same pre-scan
         that strips unwanted whitespace nodes can also concatenate adjacent text nodes (eliminating
         entity references and CDATA sections in the process); presenting a view of adjacent
         text nodes as a single node accounts for a great deal of complexity (and lines of
         code, and execution time) in navigating a DOM. Equally for namespaces. To determine
         the namespace part of the name of an element or attribute, Saxon can't simply call
         getNamespaceURI() on the underlying DOM node. That method is defined to have no effect
         if "the node was created using DOM level-1 interfaces". Saxon of course has no idea
         how the node was created, and DOM provides no way of finding out. So it does an optimistic
         call of getNamespaceURI() just in case, and if this returns null then it has no choice
         but to search the node's ancestors and attributes looking for namespace declarations
         - and since this is done every time you look at a node to see whether it satisfies
         an axis step, it's no wonder that Saxon can be ten times slower processing a DOM than
         when processing its native tree structure. We should be able to cut this cost dramatically
         by doing a pre-scan of the document and calling setNamespaceURI() on all element and
         attribute nodes.
         </p>
      <p>
         The more I think about this, the more appealing the idea of doing the same thing on
         Big Saxon. The fact is, most people who supply a DOM as input to XSLT do so out of
         ignorance; they have no idea of the extra costs they are incurring, or of the fact
         that supplying SAX input would be ten times faster. It's important to deliver good
         performance not only to experts who know how to get the ultimate performance out of
         the system, but also to the average user who just copies JAXP code from somewhere
         on the web without any great thought or understanding. For that kind of user, in-situ
         modification of the supplied DOM might be the right answer. We can always continue
         to provide wrapping or bulk-copying as alternative configuration options, for people
         to invoke if they don't like their data being trampled upon.
         </p>
      <p>
         Returning to Saxon-CE, the other complication is the HTML DOM. Running XPath against
         an HTML DOM is already sufficiently quirky (e.g. because of case-insensitive element
         names, namespace non-support, etc etc) that it's probably wisest to keep things as
         simple as possible on this front. I don't think we need to apply xsl:strip-space directives
         to the HTML document; there's nothing in the spec that would make this a conformance
         issue, and there's no usability imperative. So we'll leave well alone here.
