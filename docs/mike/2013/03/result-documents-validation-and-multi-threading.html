      <p>I've been working on a stylesheet that converts the W3C XQuery/XPath 3.0 test suite
         into an XSLT 3.0 test suite. The idea is that all the XPath tests only need to be
         written once, allowing them to form XSLT tests and thus avoiding the duplication of
         effort that arises if separate test suites are written.
         </p>
      <p>
         The stylesheet generates 19,700 output files (38Mb) from 1,863 input files (122Mb)
         so it's a good test in its own right. I'm therefore running it using the almost-ready
         Saxon 9.5 as part of the system testing before we ship the product. Here are a few
         points I'd like to highlight.
         </p>
      <p>
         Firstly, some files are copied unchanged. For this purpose the extension function
         file:copy(), which is part of the EXPath file module, comes in very handy. This llibrary
         will be included as standard with Saxon 9.5 (like all extensions, it will be in the
         PE and EE editions only).
         </p>
      <p>
         Secondly, I followed a development approach which I've found very useful and would
         like to share. There's a schema for the target document vocabulary (the XSLT 3 test
         suite metadata), so it makes sense to use a schema-aware stylesheet that validates
         the result documents as they are produced. However, I don't switch on validation until
         the transformation is "roughly working", that is, until it produces output that looks
         correct to the naked eye. The reason for that is simply that the validation error
         messages are a nuisance during the stage when you know the transformation is incomplete
         and incorrect. It's only when the transformation is running without errors and handling
         all the input that you need to start checking that the output is correct, and at this
         stage adding an xsl:import-schema declaration for the output schema, plus the attribute
         validation='strict" on the xsl:result-document instruction, is absolutely invaluable.
         </p>
      <p>
         Except, I found it could be improved. The validation error messages tell you what's
         wrong (for example, you've output an attribute value which isn't allowed for that
         attribute), and they tell you where the code is in the stylesheet that caused the
         error (the offending xsl:attribute or xsl:copy instruction), but they weren't telling
         you what input was being processed at the time: where did the offending attribute
         value come from? So I've fixed that, or at least tried to. It's one of those cases
         that sounds easy but is actually quite tricky, because the code that detects the validation
         error is very remote from any code than knows where we are in the source document
         (or indeed, which of 1,863 source documents we are processing) at the time. The way
         I've done this is that the PipelineConfiguration - which holds all the context information
         used by a push pipeline, including schema valdiation - now includes a stack of items
         representing items being processed using xsl:apply-templates; so the validation error
         message can tell you what the latest node processed by a template rule is. Doesn't
         work unfortunately for those who use monolithic xsl:for-each structures, or for those
         who use XQuery - but this is specifically focussed on this kind of workload handling
         many inputs and many outputs, for which XQuery is unsuitable anyway. There is of course
         a small performance hit for maintaining this stack, but I'm confident it's very small,
         and I always reckon that a small amount of machine time to save a large amount of
         programmer time is a good trade-off.
         </p>
      <p>
         The third thing I wanted to mention in this article is asynchronous processing of
         xsl:result-document. This is a new feature for Saxon-EE 9.5. By default, an xsl:result-document
         instruction executes in its own thread, independently of the rest of the stylesheet.
         Threads are allocated from a pool, whose size defaults to the number of processors
         available (on my Mac laptop, that's 8). If no free threads are available, the instruction
         executes in the current thread.
         </p>
      <p>
         I did some experiments on the performance as the number of available threads is increased:
         </p>
      <p>
         1 - 14.3s
         4 - 8.52s
         8 - 8.92s
         12 - 9.81s
         16 - 10.6s
         </p>
      <p>
         so the default of 8 appears to be a reasonable choice. The saving in elapsed time
         by using multi-threading seems to be well worth having, though frankly, for a task
         like this, 14s is already fantastically good performance and any improvement is simply
         icing on the cake. It's becoming quite hard to find workloads where performance improvements
         are genuinely needed.
         </p>
      <p>
         Incidentally, switching bytecode generation off has almost no noticeable effect on
         this transformation, and the same is true when optimization is switched off. That's
         because it's a very simple transformation that happens to be processing a large amount
         of data.
         </p>
      <p>
         The xsl:result-document instruction is a good candidate for parallel processing because
         there's no need to combine its results with those of any other instruction, which
         minimizes the synchronization overheads that usually come with parallel processing.
         However, there is still some synchronization needed, for example because global variables
         are evaluated lazily, so there is the chance that two threads will encounter the same
         unevaluated variable. Unfortunately finding all these cases is very difficult to do
         methodically, and this test stylesheet found a few bugs that needed to be addressed.
         Realistically, it's likely there will be further bugs that we won't hit until after
         release. So we've been careful to make sure the feature can be disabled - that's proved
         very useful with bytecode generation, which is another area where it inevitably took
         a few months of field exposure to iron out the last bugs.
