        <p>Since I last wrote about <a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2024/12/ordered-maps.html">ordered maps</a>,
        the XPath 4.0 specifications have now introduced the idea of JNodes, which adds a new set of 
        requirements to the specification.</p>
        
        <p>I wrote about JNodes in <a href="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol30/html/Kay01/BalisageVol30-Kay01.html">my paper at Balisage 2025</a>, 
        and I won't repeat the introduction here. Suffice it to say that a JNode can wrap a specific entry in an XDM
        map, and it allows you (among other things) to:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Establish which of two entries in the same map comes first in document order (or equivalently,
            in map order);</li>
            <li>Get the preceding or following siblings of a map entry (the entries that precede it or follow it 
                in map order).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The prototype implementation of JNodes that I demonstrated at Balisage included support for these
        operations, but the implementation would be hopelessly inefficient in production. The current implementation
        of ordered maps on the Saxon 13 development branch uses the <code>LinkedHashMap</code> implementation
            from the VAVR library, and this doesn't have anything that would support either of these operations.</p>
        
        <p>I'm therefore proposing to use a home-grown map implementation as described below.</p>
        
        <p>First note that <code>map:put</code> and <code>map:remove</code> operations are rare, and it's OK
        to have a map implementation that allows the map to be constructed by a mutable builder class in one phase of operation,
        and thereafter to be read-only. If a <code>map:put</code> or <code>map:remove</code> operation is attempted,
        we can rebuild the map using a different (immutable | persistent | functional) data structure. 
        So let's first consider a structure that 
        doesn't support <code>map:put</code> and <code>map:remove</code> operations directly. I'm calling this
        a <code>FixedMap</code>.</p>
        
        <p>A <code>FixedMap</code> is underpinned by three Java structures:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><code>keys</code>: An array of keys: type <code>AtomicValue[]</code>.</li>
            <li><code>values</code>: An array of values: type <code>GroundedValue[]</code>.</li>
            <li><code>index</code>: A map from atomic match keys to integers: type <code>Map&lt;AtomicMatchKey, Integer&gt;&gt;</code>.
            Note that this map doesn't need to be ordered. The class <code>AtomicMatchKey</code> is a surrogate
            for an XDM atomic value whose Java <code>equals()</code> method respects the XDM equality
            semantics: for example, if the key is an <code>xs:string</code> then the <code>AtomicMatchKey</code>
            is an instance of Saxon's <code>UnicodeString</code> class.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The basic operations on XDM maps are simply and efficiently implemented as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Get the value corresponding to a given key: set <code>i = index.get(key)</code>;
                return if <code>i == null</code> then <code>null</code> else <code>values[i]</code>.</li>
            <li>Get all keys in map order: iterate over <code>keys</code>.</li>
            <li>Get all values in map order: iterate over <code>values</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The new operations required to support JNode navigation can also be efficiently implemented:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Determine which of two entries with keys <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> is first in document
                order: compare <code>index.get(X)</code> with <code>index.get(Y)</code> (an integer comparison).</li>
            <li>Get preceding or following siblings of an entry with key <code>X</code>: find <code>index.get(X)</code>
            and then iterate forwards or backwards in the <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code> arrays
            from this integer offset.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>All very straightforward. Now, what about <code>map:put</code> and <code>map:remove</code>?</p>
        
        <p>When one of these operations occurs, I propose to copy the <code>FixedMap</code> to an
        <code>ExtensibleMap</code>. This will have a very similar structure to the <code>FixedMap</code>, except
        that:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The arrays of keys and values are replaced by immutable lists of keys and values. 
            I propose to implement these immutable lists using the existing Saxon class <code>ZenoChain</code>.
            This is described in a <a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2021/03/zeno_chains.html">previous blog</a>.    
            This uses the same logic as the <code>ZenoString</code> which I introduced in 
            <a href="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol26/html/Kay01/BalisageVol26-Kay01.html">a 2021 Balisage paper.</a>
            It provides efficient support for getting an entry at a particular integer offset, and for appending
            individual entries at the end of the list: therefore for <code>map:get</code> and <code>map:put</code>.</li>
            <li>The map from <code>AtomicMatchKey</code> to <code>Integer</code> is replaced by an immutable map.
            There are plenty of implementations available (we could revert to the Michael Froh implementation
            used in earlier Saxon releases), because there is no need for this structure to support ordering.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The design relies on the fact that adding or removing entries to the map does not change the integer
        offset of existing entries. That's fine for <code>map:put</code>, which always puts new entries at the end
        (in terms of map ordering). To support <code>map:remove</code>, I propose to keep a separate list holding
        the integer offsets of map entries that have been removed; a traversal of the map keys or arrays needs
        to check this list and skip an entry if it is present. When the number of removed entries exceeds some
        threshold (a rare event) we can rebuild the map from scratch.</p>
        
        <p>The new design looks as if all the main operations perform in constant or logarithmic time, with traversal
        of the map in linear time; and it seems to be reasonably economical in terms of memory usage.</p>
        
        <p>The design allows the use of an optimization whereby the index (from atomic match keys to integer offsets)
        is built lazily, the first time <code>map:get</code> is called. This is useful when processing JSON, because
        it's likely that many maps constructed during JSON parsing will either be copied unchanged to the
        transformation output, or will never be referenced at all, so the work needed to construct an index can be
        saved (it's still necessary to check for duplicate keys, but this can be done cheaply with a simple Bloom
        filter).</p>
        
        <p>We currently have an optimized implementation of maps for cases where all the keys are known in advance
        to be instances of <code>xs:string</code>. This can potentially save a bit of space because in place
            of the <code>StringValue</code> representing each string-valued key, we can simply store the underlying
            <code>UnicodeString</code>. This saves holding the wrapper object and the type annotation, which can
            be significant in the case of very large maps.</p>
        
        <p>One of the benefits of this design is that it reduces our dependencies on third-party code, which in
        turn simplifies porting Saxon across different platforms, and transpiling to C# for the .NET platform.
        In the current Saxon 13 code base, we're not only dependent on the VAVR library, but we're actually
        dependent on a fork of that library that uses a different implentation of linked hash maps, to avoid
        a <a href="https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2727">performance bug</a>.</p>
