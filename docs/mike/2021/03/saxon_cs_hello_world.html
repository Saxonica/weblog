        <p>The Saxon product on .NET has been living on borrowed time for a while.
        It's built by converting the Java bytecode of the Java product to the 
        equivalent .NET intermediate language, using the open-source IKVM converter
        produced by Jeroen Frijters. Jeroen after many years of devoted service
        decided to give up further development and maintenance of IKVM a few
        years ago, which didn't immediately matter because the product worked
        perfectly well. But then Microsoft in 2019 announced that future
        .NET developments would be based on .NET Core, and IKVM has never supported
        .NET Core, so we clearly had a problem.</p>
        <p>There's a team attempting to produce a fork of IKVM that supports
        the new .NET, but we've never felt we could put all our eggs in that basket.
        In any case, we also have performance problems with IKVM that we've never
        managed to resolve: some applications run 5 times slower than Java, and
        despite a lot of investigation, we've never worked out why.</p>
        <p>So we decided to try a new approach, namely Java-to-C# source code
        conversion. After a lot of work, we've now achieved successful compilation
        and execution of a subset of the the code, and for the first time this
        morning, Saxon-CS successfully ran the minimal "Hello World" query.</p>
        <p>We're a long way from having a product we can release, but we can now
        have confidence that this approach is going to be viable.</p>
        <p>How does the conversion work? We looked at some available tools,
        notably the product from Tangible Solutions, and this gave us many
        insights into what could be readily converted, and where the remaining
        difficulties lay; it also convinced us that we'd be better off writing
        our own converter.</p>
        <p>The basic workflow is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the open source JavaParser library, parse the Java code, generate
            an XML abstract syntax tree for each module, and annotate the syntax tree with type information
            where needed.</li>
            <li>Using XSLT code, do a cross-module analysis to determine which methods override each other,
            which have covariant return types, etc: information needed when generating the C# code.</li>
            <li>Perform an XSLT transformation on each module to generate C# code.</li>           
        </ol>
        <p>We can't convert everything automatically, so there's a range of strategies we use to
        deal with the remaining issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some constructs can simply be avoided. We have trouble, for example, converting
            Java method references like <code>Item::toString</code>, because it needs a fair bit of 
            context information to distinguish the various possible translations. But it's no great
            hardship to write the Java code a different way, for example as a lambda expression
            <code>item -&gt; item.toString()</code>. Another example is naming conflicts: C# doesn't
            allow you, for example, to have a variable with the same name as a method in the containing
            class. It's no hardship to rename the variables so the problem doesn't arise.</li>
            <li>We can use Java annotations to steer the conversion. For example, sometimes
            we want to generate C# code that's completely unrelated to the Java code. We can move
            this code into a method of its own, and then add an annotation <code>@CSharpReplaceMethodBody</code>
            which substitutes different code for the existing method body. The annotation is copied
            into the XML syntax tree by the JavaParser, and our converter can pick it up from there.</li>
            <li>We already have a preprocessor mechanism to mark chunks of code as being excluded from
            particular variants of the product (such as Saxon-HE or Saxon-PE). We can make further use
            of this mechanism. However, it's limited by the fact that the code, prior to preprocessing,
            must be valid Java so that it works in the IDE.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The areas that have caused most trouble in conversion are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inner classes. C# has no anonymous inner classes, and its named inner classes correspond
            only to Java's static inner classes. Guided by the way the Tangible converter handles these,
            we've found a way of translating them that handles most cases, and we've added Java annotations
            that provide the converter with extra information where additional complexities arise.</li>
            <li>Enumeration types. C#'s enumeration types are much more limited than the equivalent in
            Java, because enumeration constants can't have custom methods associated with them. We distinguish
            three kinds of enumeration classes: singleton enumerations (used to implement classes that will
            only have a single instance); simple enumerations with no custom behaviour, which can be translated
            to C# enumerations very directly, and more complex enumerations, that result in the generation
            of two separate C# classes, one to hold the enumeration constants, the other to accommodate the
            custom methods.</li>
            <li>Generics. C# is much stricter about generic types than Java, because the type information
            is carried through to run-time, whereas in Java it is used only for compile-time type checking,
            which can be subverted by use of casting. So the rule in C# is, either use generics properly,
            or don't use them at all. We anticipated some of these issues a year or two ago when we
            first started thinking about this project: see 
                <a href="/mike/2020/01/java-generics-revisited.html">Java Generics Revisited</a>.
            The result is that the classes representing XDM sequences and sequence iterators no longer use
            generics, which has saved a lot of hassle in this conversion. But there are still many
            problems, notably (a) the type inference needed to support Java's diamond operator (as in 
            <code>new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()</code>, where an explicit type parameter is needed in C#),
            and (b) the handling of covariant and contravariant wildcards (<code>? extends T</code>,
            <code>? super T</code>.)</li>
            <li>Iterators and enumerators. A <code>for-each</code> loop in Java (<code>for (X x : collection)</code>)
                relies on the <code>collection</code> operand implementing the <code>java.lang.Iterable</code>
                interface. To translate this into a C# for-each loop (<code>foreach (X x in collection)</code>)
                the <code>collection</code> needs to implement <code>IEnumerable</code>. So we convert
                all Iterables to IEnumerables, and that means we have to convert Iterators to Enumerators.
                Unfortunately Java's <code>Iterator</code> interface doesn't lend itself to static
                translation to a c# <code>IEnumerator</code>: in Java, the <code>hasNext()</code>
                method is stateless (so you can call it repeatedly), whereas C#'s <code>MoveNext</code>
                changes the current position (so you can't). We're fortunate that we only make
                modest use of Java iterators; in most of the code, we use Saxon's <code>SequenceIterator</code>
                interface in preferance, and this converts without trouble. We examined all the cases
                where Saxon explicitly uses <code>hasNext()</code> and <code>next()</code>, and made
                sure these followed the discipline of calling <code>hasNext()</code> exactly once
            before each call on <code>next()</code>; with this discipline, converting the calls to
            <code>MoveNext()</code> and <code>Current</code> works without problems.</li>
            <li>Lambda expressions and delegates. In Java, lambda expressions can be used where the
            expected type is a <i>functional interface</i>; a functional interface in other ways is just
            an ordinary interface, and you can have concrete classes that implement it. So for example
            the second argument of <code>NodeInfo.iterateAxis(axis, nodeTest)</code> is a <code>NodeTest</code>,
            for which we can supply either a lambda expression (such as <code>it -&gt; it instanceof XSLExpose</code>),
            or one of a whole range of implementation classes such as a <code>SchemaElementTest</code>,
            which tests whether an element belongs to an XSD-defined substitution group. In C#, lambda expressions
            can only be used when the expected type is a delegate, and if the expected type is a delegate,
            then (in effect) a lambda expression is the only thing you can supply. The way we've handled this
            is generally to make the main method (like <code>iterateAxis()</code> expect a non-delegate
            interface, and then to supply a proxy implementation of this interface that accepts a delegate.
            It's not a very satisfactory solution, but it works.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>One area where we could have had trouble, but avoided it, is in the use of the Java
        <code>CharSequence</code> class. I wrote about this issue last year at
            <a href="/mike/2020/07/string-charsequence-ikvm-and-net.html">String, 
                CharSequence, IKVM, and .NET</a>. As described in that article, we decided to eliminate
        our dependence on the <code>CharSequence</code> interface. For a great many internal uses of strings
        in Saxon, we now use a new interface <code>UnicodeString</code> which as the name implies is much
        more Unicode-friendly than Java's <code>String</code> and <code>CharSequence</code>. It also reduces
        memory usage, especially in the TinyTree. But there is a small overhead in the places where we
        have to convert strings to or from <code>UnicodeStrings</code>, which we can't hide entirely:
        it represents about 5% on the bottom line. But it does make all this code much easier to port
        between Java and C#.</p>
        
        <p>What about dependencies? So far we've just been tackling the Saxon-HE code base, and that has
        very few dependencies that have caused any difficulty. Most of the uses of standard Java library
        classes (maps, lists, input and output streams, and the like) are handled by the converter,
        simply translating calls into the nearest C# equivalent. In some cases such as <code>java.util.Properties</code>
        we've written en emulation of the Java interface (or the parts of it that we actually use). In other
        cases we've redirected calls to helper methods. For example we don't always have enough type
        information to know whether Java's <code>List.remove()</code> should be translated to
        <code>List.Remove()</code> or <code>List.RemoveAt()</code>; so instead we generate a call on
        a static helper method, which makes the decision at runtime based on the type of the
        supplied argument.</p>
        
        <p>The only external dependency we've picked up so far is for handling big decimal numbers.
        We're currently evaluating the <code>BigDecimal</code> library from Singulink, which appears
        to offer all the required functionality, though its philosophy is sufficiently different
        from the Java <code>BigDecimal</code> to make conversion non-trivial.</p>
        
        <p>One thing I should stress is that we haven't written a general purpose Java to C# converter.
            Our converter is designed to handle the Saxon codebase, and nothing else. Some of the
            conversion rules are specific to particular Saxon classes, and as a general principle,
            we only convert the subset of the language and of the class library that we actually need.
            Some of the conversion rules assume that the code is written to the coding conventions
            that we use in Saxon, but which might not be followed in other projects.</p>
        
        <p>So, Hello World to Saxon-CS. There's still a lot of work to do, but we've reached a significant
        milestone.</p>
