            <p>Arrays were added to the data model for XPath 3.1 (and XQuery 3.1): the main motivation 
                was the need for faithful representation of JSON data structures, while a secondary 
                consideration was the long-standing requirement for "sequences of sequences".
            </p>
            <p>Processing support for arrays in the current languages is rather limited. There's 
                a basic set of functions available, but not much else. Support in XSLT 3.0 is 
                particularly weak, because XSLT 3.0 was primarily designed to work with XPath 3.0 
                (which didn't have arrays), with 3.1 support added as something of an afterthought.
            </p>
            <p>This note surveys where the gaps are, and how they should be filled.
            </p>
            <p>Many of the complications in processing arrays arise because the members of an array 
                can be arbitrary sequences, not just single items. There were two reasons for this 
                design. One is simply orthogonality: the principle of no unnecessary restrictions. 
                The other was support for the JSON null value, which maps naturally to an empty 
                sequence in XDM, but only if an array is allowed have an empty sequence as one of its members.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Array Construction</h2>
            
            <p>XPath 3.1 offers two constructs for creating arrays: the "square" and "curly" 
                constructors. Neither is completely general. The "square" constructor (for 
                example <code>[$X, $Y, $Z]</code>) can construct an array with arbitrary values as its 
                members, but the size of the array needs to be known statically. The "curly" 
                constructor (for example <code>array{$X, $Y, $Z}</code>) can construct an array whose size 
                is decided dynamically, but the members of the array must be singleton items 
                (not arbitrary sequences). The WG failed to come up with a construct for creating 
                an array where both the size of the array and the size of each member are 
                determined dynamically. The only way to achieve this is with a fairly convoluted 
                use of functions such as <code>array:join()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>XSLT 3.0 has no mechanism for array construction. An <code>xsl:array</code> instruction has 
                been proposed, and is prototyped as <code>saxon:array</code> in current Saxon releases; 
                but the difficulty is in defining the detail of how it should 
                work. It makes sense for it to enclose a sequence constructor, so instructions 
                like <code>xsl:for-each</code> and <code>xsl:choose</code> can be used when building the content. 
                But sequence constructors deliver sequences of items, not sequences of sequences.
                So the current proposal for <a href="https://qt4cg.org/branch/master/xslt-40/Overview.html#array-construction">XSLT 4.0</a>
                envisages an <code>xsl:array-member</code> instruction that wraps a sequence as a zero-arity
                function. The problem with this is that the mechanism is transparent yet arbitrary;
                it looks like (and is) a kludge.
            </p>
            <h2>Array Processing</h2>
            
            <p>Similarly, there are limited options for processing of arrays. There's no 
                equivalent of the "for" clause in FLWOR expressions that binds a variable 
                to each member of an array in turn. The closest things on offer are the 
                <code>array:filter()</code> and <code>array:for-each()</code> higher order functions – which are 
                more useful in XQuery than in XSLT, because of the difficulty in XSLT 
                of writing an anonymous function that constructs new XML element nodes. 
                XSLT in particular relies heavily (in constructs such as <code>xsl:apply-templates</code>, 
                <code>xsl:for-each</code>, <code>xsl:iterate</code>, and <code>xsl:for-each-group</code>) on binding values implicitly 
                to the context item. But the context item is an item, not an arbitrary value, 
                so binding members of arrays to the context item isn't an option.
            </p>
            <p>Generalizing "." to represent an arbitrary value rather than a single item seems 
                an attractive idea, but it's very hard to do without breaking a lot of existing code.
            </p>
            <p>Iterating over an array and binding each member to a variable works well in XQuery,
            where adding a "for member" clause to FLWOR expressions works cleanly enough. But there's
            lots of other functionality for processing sequences that can't be translated easily
            into equivalent mechanisms for arrays, especially in XSLT.</p>
        
            <h2>Parcels</h2>
            
            <p>It seems that a solution for both array construction and array processing is to find 
                a way to pack an arbitrary sequence into a single item. We'll refer to a "sequence 
                packed into an item" as a parcel. We can then construct an array from a sequence 
                of parcels, and we can decompose an array into a sequence of parcels, allowing 
                both operations to be implemented using all the existing machinery for handling 
                sequences. 
            </p>
            <p>It seems that four operations are sufficient to fill the processing gap:
            </p>
            <ul><li>Wrap a sequence as a parcel</li>
            <li>Unwrap a parcel as a sequence</li>
            <li>Construct an array from a sequence of parcels</li>
            <li>Decompose an array into a sequence of parcels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So four functions should do the job: <code>parcel(item()*) =&gt; P</code>, 
                <code>unparcel(P) =&gt; item()*</code>, <code>array:of(P*) as array(*)</code>, <code>array:members(array(*)) as P*</code>, 
                where <code>P</code> is the item type of a parcel. Of course, we can also add XSLT or XQuery syntactic 
                sugar on top of these building blocks.
            </p>
            <p>We now have to address the question: what kind of item is a parcel? Is it represented using something we 
                already know and love (like an array, or a zero-arity function) or is it something new? How should 
                the type of a parcel be represented in type signatures, and what operations (apart from the above four) 
                should be available on them?
            </p>
            <p>I'm beginning to come to the conclusion that the type safety that comes from treating a parcel as a 
                new kind of item justifies the extra complexity in the type system. If we reuse an existing 
                kind of item (for example, zero-arity functions), then there's always going to be confusion about 
                whether items of that type are to be treated as parcels or as their "ordinary selves".
            </p>
            <p>However, I'm reluctant to add yet another fundamental type. We can't keep adding fundamental 
                types, and new syntax, every time we need something new (cf my Balisage 2020 paper on adding 
                promises). Can't we make the type system more extensible?
            </p>
            <p>Pro tem, I suggest we build on the concept of "extension objects" defined in §25.1.3 of 
                the XSLT specification. These are intended as opaque objects that can be returned by 
                one extension function and supplied to another. This concept should really be defined 
                in XDM rather than in XSLT. We should add that an "extension object" may be an instance 
                of an "extension type", and that extension types are denoted in the ItemType syntax by a 
                QName (that is, the same syntax as atomic types), with the QName being made known to the 
                processor in some implementation-defined way. Then we reserve a namespace URI sys for 
                "built in extension types", and define sys:parcel as such a type.
            </p>
