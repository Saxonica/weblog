<h1>Two steps forward…</h1>

<p><a href="https://qt4cg.org/">QT4CG</a>, the commuity group developing the
4.0 versions of XPath, XQuery, XSLT, and related specifications, has been hard
at work now for more than three years. We just had our 151st meeting.</p>

<p>It’s a large body of work. Lots of changes have been requested: there are
2,437 issues today, with 70 remaining open. Lots of changes have been proposed,
drafted, reviewed and accepted (or rejected, as the case may be): there are
2,441 pull requests today, with 12 currently open. We’ve added tests to the test
suite and implementations are underway.</p>

<p>I’m pleased, in my role as chair of the group, to announce that we’ve
published our first set of “<a href="https://qt4cg.org/#drafts-2026-01-28">stable drafts</a>”.
These <em>are not</em> final specifications, but they do reflect the consensus of
the group near the end of January, 2026. The
<a href="https://qt4cg.org/#speclist">current drafts</a> are still the place to look for the most
recent consensus positions.</p>

<p>Publishing dated, stable drafts serves a couple of purposes. First and
foremost, it gives users and implementors a stable set of documents to refer to.
As Saxonica works towards a Saxon 13 release, we’ll be able to make assertions
about what features we do (or do not) support, confident that those features
won’t change in the draft we’re referencing. Those features may still change, of
course, but we can say we implemented against a stable draft.</p>

<p>It’s also a strong signal to the community that we think we’re making
progress towards the finish line. </p>

<p><em>Yes, but when will you be done</em>, I hear you ask?</p>

<p>In practical terms, when the group thinks the specifications are complete and
coherent, and when it agrees to stop changing them. That’s a
social engineering issue, not a technical one. Specifications, perhaps even more than code,
are governed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule">90/90 rule</a>:
the first 90% of drafting takes 90% of the time, the remaining 10% of drafting takes the
other 90% of the time.</p>

<p>Personally, I’ll be <em>very</em> surprised if we finish in 2026 (that remaining 10%
really is <em>a lot</em> of work), and surprised [if somewhat less <em>very</em>], if
we don’t finish in 2027. </p> </div></content></entry><entry><title>Saxonica takes SaxonC to the GraalVM community summit</title><link href="https://blog.saxonica.com/oneil/2025/11/14-graalvm-community-summit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><id>https://blog.saxonica.com/oneil/2025/11/14-graalvm-community-summit.html</id><published>2025-11-14T17:30:00Z</published><content type="xhtml" xml:base="https://blog.saxonica.com/oneil/2025/11/14-graalvm-community-summit.html"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<br/>
<img src="graalvm_summit25.jpg" type="image/jpg"/>

<p>Saxonica is a small company, but we’re doing innovative work all the same. In October,
            Matt Patterson and I represented Saxonica at the <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/community/summit/">GraalVM Community Summit</a> at Oracle’s
            offices in Zurich, because of the work we’re doing using <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM’s Native Image</a>
            technology in <a href="https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-c/index.xml">SaxonC</a>.</p>
        <p>It was an excellent chance to put faces to names, ask and answer questions, get to show
            what we’re doing, and ask the engineers behind the tools detailed questions. The GraalVM
            team were welcoming and more than willing to dive in.</p>
        <p>There were all sorts of people with an interest in contributing to and using GraalVM,
            from the biggest players in the industry to small companies like ours, and it was good
            to see the sheer enthusiasm and investment that is being contributed into GraalVM and in
            their projects.</p>
        <p>This year’s summit came at an especially interesting time, following the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java/detaching-graalvm-from-the-java-ecosystem-train">announcement</a>
            that GraalVM will be decoupled from the Oracle Java release schedule. That change has
            sparked fresh discussions about the future direction of the JDK. It was reassuring to
            hear from the core team that they remain deeply committed; not only to GraalVM’s
            continued development but also to its non-Java languages, including GraalPy and GraalJS,
            which are rapidly maturing.</p>
        <p>During the unconference sessions, we had the opportunity to share how Saxonica is using
            GraalVM to build SaxonC as a shared library. We discussed our experiences with the
            performance costs of crossing the C/C++ boundary with Java and limits we apply for
            improvements, and our efforts to enable calling C, C++, PHP, and Python native functions
            from Java as the host language, a long-requested feature we’re aiming to deliver user
            defined extension function for XSLT, XQuery and in XPath. We are in the home stretch now
            for releasing this feature in SaxonC 13.</p>
        <p>One of the most valuable parts of the summit was being in the same room as the GraalVM
            developers themselves. We compared development approaches for the C Native API vs. JNI;
            and learned that JNI has evolved considerably in recent years. Even so, we’ve decided to
            stick with the C Native API to keep things low level and for the use of function pointer
            indirection for now, as it best fits our architecture and goals.</p>
        <p>The unconference sessions also featured a range of fascinating talks, from BellSoft’s
            work on parallel processing in Liberica, to developments in GraalJS/Wasm and Spring. The
            Crema project, which tackles dynamic class loading in native-image was impressive and
            may benefit SaxonC in the future. And the Shenandoah garbage collector from Amazon
            promises to deliver exciting improvements for high-performance Java applications.</p>
        <p>For a “small” company like Saxonica, being part of these conversations and contributing
            to the future of the JVM and polyglot ecosystem feels immensely rewarding. We left
            Zurich energised, inspired, and ready to keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible
            with GraalVM.</p>

<p>I’m asking for help, but first, a little background. Saxon 10.x is the last Saxon release that
supported Microsoft .NET Framework. The Saxon 11 and 12 releases only run on
.NET Core. But we still have customers with applications that need .NET
Framework and Microsoft continues to support it on Windows.</p>

<p>We’d like to be able to provide a .NET Framework version of SaxonCS built
from the current sources. In principle, this should be possible because we build
SaxonCS by transpiling Java source code to C# source code (mixed in with some
hand-written C#).</p>

<p>I undertook to see if I could make that work. I took a SaxonCS 12.x build and
attempted to compile it with .NET Framework. I worked back and forth on the
transpiler and on the generated C# code until I got something that compiled.</p>

<p>But a simple
<a href="https://dev.saxonica.com/12.99.99/identity.xsl">identity transformation</a>
fails with an <code>AccessViolationException</code>:</p>

<pre><code>

<p>No amount of effort on my part has enabled me to find out where that problem occurs, or why.
In the debugger, it’s on a perfectly harmless looking statement and taking one step forward
immediately crashes the process.
We got a Windows consultant (he’s helping us with some performance analysis, but he knows
a lot more about Windows than I do) to take a look.</p>

<p>Thing is, it works on his machine. My build works on his machine, his build fails on my machine.
And those builds fail on some other machines too.</p>

<p>I expressed some frustration (*cough*) at a team meeting and threatened to just pull the plug
on the whole thing. But, we seem to be so close…</p>

<p>Mike said, “why don’t we ask the internet”. So that’s what I’m doing. If you’re a Windows
developer, you can get the entirely janky
<a href="https://dev.saxonica.com/12.99.99/SaxonCS-net481-12-99-99.zip">SaxonCS-net481-12-99-99.zip</a>
build and run it through your favorite debugging tools. If you can
show me what I’ve done wrong, I would be ever so grateful. (To the tune of a free
individual license, if you like.)</p>

<p>A few points about the build:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s a .NET Framework 4.8.1 Windows/X86 build.</li>
<li>It’s really janky; it’s from C# source code that I’ve hacked on mercilessly.</li>
<li>It emits a bunch of random debugging messages.</li>
<li>It won’t read a license file and there’s no way to enable licensable features.</li>
<li>Some commands do succeed, but that identity transform fails on some machines.</li>
<li>It should go without saying, but I’m going to say it anyway, do not use that
build for anything except testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The failure isn’t related to the version of Windows (at least not the major
version number). We aren’t able to see any obvious differences in the SDKs
installed or the build tools used between machines where it succeeds and where
it fails.</p>

<p>Can you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Explain why it succeeds on some machines and fails on others?</li>
<li>Tell me what to change so that it will always succeed?</li>
</ol>

<p>Clues most humbly solicited, if it’s the sort of puzzle that interests you.
I recognize that not being able to provide the source code and build environment 
is a serious limitation.</p>

<p>If it helps, here are the build commands I used:</p>

<pre><code>dotnet restore SaxonCS.sln --verbosity Normal -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform="Any CPU"
dotnet build SaxonCS.sln --verbosity Normal /nodereuse:false --no-restore \
       -p:Version=12.99.99 -p:PackageVersion=12.99.99 -p:Configuration=Release \
       -p:Platform="Any CPU" -p:DefineConstants=EE
dotnet publish SaxonCS.sln -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=false \
       -p:Version=12.99.99 -p:PackageVersion=12.99.99 -p:Configuration=Release \
       -p:Platform="Any CPU"</code></pre>

<p>🤞</p>

<p>We’ve made a couple of Saxon 12 releases where we (once intentionally, once
accidentally) built the Java release without support for JDK 8. Users
noticed.</p>

<p>We’re starting to think about Saxon 13 and we’re definitely planning to move
the minimum Java version forward. There are still a few years left in JDK 8
extended service support, but our build tools are beginning to issue deprecation
warnings for it.</p>

<p>JDK 8 was released more than a decade ago. There have been a lot of Java
language improvements in the intervening years and we’re starting to take
advantage of some of them.</p>

<p>It makes sense to choose a “long term service” (LTS) release. We’ll want to
avoid changing the version during maintenance releases. The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html">Java
LTS releases</a> are 11, 17, 21, and 25. Premier support for 11 has already
ended and version 25 was only released last month, that’s probably too
aggressive.</p>

<p>That leaves 17 or 21. We’re leaning towards Java 17, but we’d welcome any
thoughts you might have.</p>

<p>For more than twenty years, it’s been possible to serve XML documents on the
web, making them available to applications as well-formed XML and to humans as
nicely formatted web pages. This is a win-win scenario for many users, but the
<a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> is moving aggressively to take away
this long-standing web capability.</p>

<p>The WHATWG is moving to deprecate, and then remove, native support for XSLT
in the browser. It’s XSLT that provides the formatted web page from an XML
document. Faced with the prospect of losing native support for XSLT in the
browser, a natural question our users ask is “can we use SaxonJS instead?” The
answer is yes, but it’s a little bit complicated.</p>

<p>Let’s step back for a moment and look (broadly) at how the web works and what’s
actually going on under the hood.</p>

<p>For the application, this is simple: it requests the web page; it gets back a
document with an <code>application/xml</code> media type; it parses it; and it does what it
does with the XML data. Job done.</p>

<p>For the human user reading the page with a web browser, there’s a little bit
more going on.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>The browser requests the page.</li>
<li>It gets back an <code>application/xml</code> page and parses it.</li>
<li>If the page has an <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The browser loads the stylesheet that the processing instruction points to;</li>
    <li>if it’s an XSLT stylesheet, it transforms the XML document with the stylesheet;</li>
    <li>and it displays the transformed result to the reader</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
   
<p>(If the document doesn’t have an <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction, the
browser just displays the raw XML in some way or another. How useful this is
depends on the browser and the XML markup.)</p>

<p>It’s the fact that the browser recognizes, and responds to, the
<code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction that starts the process off.
This document:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="/xslt/atom.xsl" type="text/xsl"?&gt;
&lt;feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"

<p>Will be styled with the <code>/xslt/atom.xsl</code> stylesheet before being
displayed because the <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing intruction on the
first line tells it to.</p>

<p>If WHATWG takes away that capability, the XML document becomes inert.</p>

<p>The challenge that we, as users, face is to find some place to stand from
which we can begin the styling process. The more common SaxonJS use case begins
with an HTML browser page, and it’s obvious how to bootstrap a JavaScript
application from there.</p>

<p>Luckily, for the moment at least, the browser will run scripts that are
embedded in the XML using the <code>script</code> element in the HTML namespace.
So that’s where we can stand. If we remove the processing instruction and add
script lines, we can run SaxonJS:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
      xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
      xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
      xml:lang="EN-us"&gt;

   &lt;script xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
           type="text/javascript" src="/js/saxon-js/SaxonJS2.rt.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
      SaxonJS.transform({
        stylesheetLocation: "/xslt/atom.sef.json",
        initialTemplate: "main"
      }, "async");
   &lt;/script&gt;

   &lt;title&gt;Saxonica Weblogs&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;link href="https://blog.saxonica.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/&gt;
   &lt;link href="https://blog.saxonica.com/atom.xml" rel="self"/&gt;
   &lt;id&gt;https://blog.saxonica.com/atom.xml&lt;/id&gt;
   …
</code></pre>

<p>I’m not going to try to give a SaxonJS tutorial here, but in brief: the first
script loads SaxonJS; the second script loads the <em>compiled</em> version of the stylesheet,
<code>/xslt/atom.sef.json</code>, and runs the template named “<code>main</code>”.
</p>

<p>The <code>/xslt/atom.xsl</code> stylesheet can remain mostly the same as the
one you’re using currently in the browser except, of course, that you can now
use XSLT 3.0 features.
One complication is that you have to add two templates to your XSLT
stylesheet. The easiest way to do that is by placing these lines in a file
called <code>saxonjs-templates.xsl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                xmlns:ixsl="http://saxonica.com/ns/interactiveXSLT"
                version="3.0"&gt;

&lt;xsl:template name="main"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="ixsl:page()" mode="format-feed"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="/" mode="format-feed"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:result-document href="?." method="ixsl:replace-content"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="."/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:result-document&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The first template is the one that is run from the script in the XML
document. It doesn’t have to be named “<code>main</code>” but the names used in
both places have to be the same. This template takes the current page, the XML
document, and processes it in the <code>format-feed</code> mode.</p>

<p>The second template just uses <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> on itself to
process the XML document in the default mode, this will run the rest of your
stylesheet, <code>/xslt/atom.xsl</code>. Surrounding that call to
apply-templates is an <code>xsl:result-document</code> instruction that will have the effect
of replacing the current document with the styled result. That’s what “<code>?.</code>” and
<code>ixsl:replace-content</code> achieve.</p>

<p>Use <code>xsl:include</code> at the top of <code>/xslt/atom.xsl</code> to include
the contents of <code>saxonjs-templates.xsl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" 
                exclude-result-prefixes="#all"
                version="3.0"&gt;
&lt;xsl:include href="saxonjs-templates.xsl"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:output method="html" html-version="5"
            encoding="utf-8" indent="no"/&gt;
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve taken the opportunity to update the version and the
<code>xsl:output</code> method as well, since we’re now using XSLT 3.0 not 1.0.</p>

<p>To compile <code>/xslt/atom.xsl</code> to <code>/xslt/atom.sef.json</code>,
you can use Saxon-EE or you can install SaxonJS on Node.js and use node,
something like this:</p>

<pre><code>node xslt3.js -xsl:xslt/atom.xsl -export:xslt/atom.sef.json -nogo -ns:##html5</code></pre>

<p>(Depending on your platform, you might have to quote or escape the hashes in <code>-ns:##html5</code>)</p>

<p>That all works. This is an unexplored use case; it’s clear that we could make
it a little simpler by adding some options to the <code>SaxonJS.transform</code>
method.</p>

<p>Not everyone will find this situation wholly satisfying. It’s a little bit
complicated and it introduces an edit-compile-debug cycle into your workflow. You
can’t just use the plain old XSL stylesheet; you have to use the compiled
version. The compiler comes with Saxon-EE and is also available for free on
Node.js, but they aren’t open source.</p>

<p>Other approaches that could be used include
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">content negotiation</a> or simply using
redirects. Content negotiation is also a little bit complicated and requires the ability
to configure the web server. Redirects are simpler, but introduce two different
URIs which might be confusing.</p>

<p>With luck, the WHATWG will be persuaded not to break the web and we won’t have to
do any of these things. But there are options.</p>

<h1>Removing XSLT from the browser</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> recently proposed to “remove
XSLT from the web platform”. This is not the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zIg2KC7PyH0">first attempt</a>.
There’s a long discussion thread on the GitHub issue for the
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523 ">current proposal</a>,
including a lot of pushback. The same is true of the
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11563">related issue</a>
to “remove mentions of XSLT from the html[sic] spec”.</p>

<p>Whether the current attempt to deprecate XSLT in the browser succeeds, or
whether feedback from users will be sufficient to discourage them again, I don’t
know. Regardless of the outcome, it's clear that we are heading closer and
closer to a monoculture in web browsers.</p>

<p>Deprecating XSLT will break a lot of web pages. Thousands of Saxonica's pages,
and perhaps tens of thousands of others. It will break web pages that have been
quietly and usefully referenced by an unknown number of users for a couple of
decades. It will break web pages that are immutable, that are not, or can no
longer be, maintained because the projects have ended or the authors have died.
Things will be forever lost because tens of thousands of pages aren’t enough.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are technical arguments in favor of removing XSLT from the
browser, including arguments about code complexity or security. And I’m sure
there are economic arguments about the importance of investing resources where
they matter most, or at least in places offering the best return on investment.
None of these arguments show consideration for the health of the web as a
reliable, open set of technologies which can be easily used by individuals and
large corporations alike.</p>

<p>Of course, building web applications with XSLT 1.0 is a considerable challenge.
This is probably the main reason why most publishers delivering complex XML
documents have continued to use XSLT on the server, where the technology is
constantly refreshed, rather than sticking with a stagnant 25-year-old
client-side implementation. Many XSLT users would happily switch to using
client-side transformation if it were actively supported by the browser vendors,
including support for later versions of the standard, which offer much higher
productivity.</p>

<p>Saxonica publishes world-class implementations of XSLT for Java, C#, C, C++,
Python, and JavaScript. Our JavaScript implementation runs both in the browser
and on NodeJS. We support the current, modern standards and we’re actively
involved in developing those standards for the future. XSLT is the most
cost-effective solution for a wide range of practical use cases, and the size
and breadth of Saxonica's user base reflects this fact.</p>

<p>XSLT will continue to survive, and thrive, even if the WHATWG insists on
depriving web developers and users of the many advantages modern XSLT would
offer them.</p>

        <h1>Ordered Maps and JNodes</h1>
        
        <p>Since I last wrote about <a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2024/12/ordered-maps.html">ordered maps</a>,
        the XPath 4.0 specifications have now introduced the idea of JNodes, which adds a new set of 
        requirements to the specification.</p>
        
        <p>I wrote about JNodes in <a href="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol30/html/Kay01/BalisageVol30-Kay01.html">my paper at Balisage 2025</a>, 
        and I won't repeat the introduction here. Suffice it to say that a JNode can wrap a specific entry in an XDM
        map, and it allows you (among other things) to:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Establish which of two entries in the same map comes first in document order (or equivalently,
            in map order);</li>
            <li>Get the preceding or following siblings of a map entry (the entries that precede it or follow it 
                in map order).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The prototype implementation of JNodes that I demonstrated at Balisage included support for these
        operations, but the implementation would be hopelessly inefficient in production. The current implementation
        of ordered maps on the Saxon 13 development branch uses the <code>LinkedHashMap</code> implementation
            from the VAVR library, and this doesn't have anything that would support either of these operations.</p>
        
        <p>I'm therefore proposing to use a home-grown map implementation as described below.</p>
        
        <p>First note that <code>map:put</code> and <code>map:remove</code> operations are rare, and it's OK
        to have a map implementation that allows the map to be constructed by a mutable builder class in one phase of operation,
        and thereafter to be read-only. If a <code>map:put</code> or <code>map:remove</code> operation is attempted,
        we can rebuild the map using a different (immutable | persistent | functional) data structure. 
        So let's first consider a structure that 
        doesn't support <code>map:put</code> and <code>map:remove</code> operations directly. I'm calling this
        a <code>FixedMap</code>.</p>
        
        <p>A <code>FixedMap</code> is underpinned by three Java structures:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><code>keys</code>: An array of keys: type <code>AtomicValue[]</code>.</li>
            <li><code>values</code>: An array of values: type <code>GroundedValue[]</code>.</li>
            <li><code>index</code>: A map from atomic match keys to integers: type <code>Map&lt;AtomicMatchKey, Integer&gt;&gt;</code>.
            Note that this map doesn't need to be ordered. The class <code>AtomicMatchKey</code> is a surrogate
            for an XDM atomic value whose Java <code>equals()</code> method respects the XDM equality
            semantics: for example, if the key is an <code>xs:string</code> then the <code>AtomicMatchKey</code>
            is an instance of Saxon's <code>UnicodeString</code> class.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The basic operations on XDM maps are simply and efficiently implemented as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Get the value corresponding to a given key: set <code>i = index.get(key)</code>;
                return if <code>i == null</code> then <code>null</code> else <code>values[i]</code>.</li>
            <li>Get all keys in map order: iterate over <code>keys</code>.</li>
            <li>Get all values in map order: iterate over <code>values</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The new operations required to support JNode navigation can also be efficiently implemented:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Determine which of two entries with keys <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> is first in document
                order: compare <code>index.get(X)</code> with <code>index.get(Y)</code> (an integer comparison).</li>
            <li>Get preceding or following siblings of an entry with key <code>X</code>: find <code>index.get(X)</code>
            and then iterate forwards or backwards in the <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code> arrays
            from this integer offset.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>All very straightforward. Now, what about <code>map:put</code> and <code>map:remove</code>?</p>
        
        <p>When one of these operations occurs, I propose to copy the <code>FixedMap</code> to an
        <code>ExtensibleMap</code>. This will have a very similar structure to the <code>FixedMap</code>, except
        that:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The arrays of keys and values are replaced by immutable lists of keys and values. 
            I propose to implement these immutable lists using the existing Saxon class <code>ZenoChain</code>.
            This is described in a <a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2021/03/zeno_chains.html">previous blog</a>.    
            This uses the same logic as the <code>ZenoString</code> which I introduced in 
            <a href="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol26/html/Kay01/BalisageVol26-Kay01.html">a 2021 Balisage paper.</a>
            It provides efficient support for getting an entry at a particular integer offset, and for appending
            individual entries at the end of the list: therefore for <code>map:get</code> and <code>map:put</code>.</li>
            <li>The map from <code>AtomicMatchKey</code> to <code>Integer</code> is replaced by an immutable map.
            There are plenty of implementations available (we could revert to the Michael Froh implementation
            used in earlier Saxon releases), because there is no need for this structure to support ordering.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The design relies on the fact that adding or removing entries to the map does not change the integer
        offset of existing entries. That's fine for <code>map:put</code>, which always puts new entries at the end
        (in terms of map ordering). To support <code>map:remove</code>, I propose to keep a separate list holding
        the integer offsets of map entries that have been removed; a traversal of the map keys or arrays needs
        to check this list and skip an entry if it is present. When the number of removed entries exceeds some
        threshold (a rare event) we can rebuild the map from scratch.</p>
        
        <p>The new design looks as if all the main operations perform in constant or logarithmic time, with traversal
        of the map in linear time; and it seems to be reasonably economical in terms of memory usage.</p>
        
        <p>The design allows the use of an optimization whereby the index (from atomic match keys to integer offsets)
        is built lazily, the first time <code>map:get</code> is called. This is useful when processing JSON, because
        it's likely that many maps constructed during JSON parsing will either be copied unchanged to the
        transformation output, or will never be referenced at all, so the work needed to construct an index can be
        saved (it's still necessary to check for duplicate keys, but this can be done cheaply with a simple Bloom
        filter).</p>
        
        <p>We currently have an optimized implementation of maps for cases where all the keys are known in advance
        to be instances of <code>xs:string</code>. This can potentially save a bit of space because in place
            of the <code>StringValue</code> representing each string-valued key, we can simply store the underlying
            <code>UnicodeString</code>. This saves holding the wrapper object and the type annotation, which can
            be significant in the case of very large maps.</p>
        
        <p>One of the benefits of this design is that it reduces our dependencies on third-party code, which in
        turn simplifies porting Saxon across different platforms, and transpiling to C# for the .NET platform.
        In the current Saxon 13 code base, we're not only dependent on the VAVR library, but we're actually
        dependent on a fork of that library that uses a different implentation of linked hash maps, to avoid
        a <a href="https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2727">performance bug</a>.</p>

<p>With the recent release of Python 3.14.0rc1, the ABI for Python 3.14 is
final, and any SaxonC Python wheels we build against it will also work with
the final 3.14 release. The TL;DR is that we’ve done that, and you can
<code>pip install saxonche</code> (or <code>saxoncee</code> /
<code>saxoncpe</code>) with the 3.14.0rc1 release right now.</p>

<p>The Python 3.13 release was trickier for us to deal with than it should have
been – our build processes required a lot more manual intervention for different
Python versions than we liked, and we had to wait for a new Saxon release to get
wheels built for Python 3.13, which was frustrating.</p>

<p>We’ve been working on improving our build processes and making  it easier to
build Python wheels across all the platforms and Python versions we support. Easy
enough, in fact, that we were able to test Python 3.14 support back at the beta
stage, and were ready to build SaxonC Python 12.8 against 3.14 as soon as the RC
dropped and the ABI was stable.</p>

<p>These new wheels were built from the same commit as the all the other SaxonC
Python 12.8 wheels for Python 3.9-3.13. We’d love for you to install 12.8 for 3.14
and kick the tires: since Python 3.14 is still RC and not at the final release stage,
there may be some problems we haven't come across. If you run into any problems,
please report them on the
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/projects/saxon-c/issues">SaxonC issue tracker</a>.
</p>

<p>There are wheels for the same platforms as always – macOS x86_64 and arm64,
Linux x86_64 and aarch64, and Windows x86_64. For macOS x86_64, Python 3.14 now
requires macOS 11 or later. As a result, Python 3.14 wheels of SaxonC Python 12.8
require macOS 11 or later on x86_64 too.</p>

<p>The accompanying release announcements for
<a href="saxon-11.7.html">Saxon 11.7</a> and
<a href="saxon-12.8.html">Saxon 12.8</a> describe those
releases in detail. This post summarizes why we decided that we
needed to release them both this week.</p>

<p>Some applications are known to use Saxon to run untrusted, user-submitted
stylesheets or queries. Running untrusted code always entails some risk. Saxon
provides two
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!configuration/config-features">features</a>
designed to help mitigate this risk: <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> and

<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code>. Setting <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code>
can limit what resources a stylesheet or query can access; it can for example,
forbid access to file: URIs. The <code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature
can disable access to reflexive Java extension functions, some system
properties, and some other extension functions. (The remit of the
<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature is a little wider than you might
expect.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we discovered a function in Saxon 11 and 12 that was not
adequately controlled by these features. In principle, a stylesheet or query
running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE could access the local filesystem even if the
<code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> feature was set to forbid such access. The risk
is small: it only applies to untrusted code running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE (it
does not apply to Saxon-HE) on a system where reading from the local filesystem
would be deemed a risk. (We would encourage anyone running untrusted code to use
a sandboxed environment where there is no data on the filesystem that needs to
be protected from read access.)</p>

<p>Although we judge the risk to be small, At Saxonica, we take security
seriously and we are publishing maintenance releases of Saxon 11 and Saxon 12 to
close this gap. We urge anyone running untrusted stylesheets or queries under
Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE to move to version 11.7 or 12.8 immediately.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonJS-HE 3.0.0-beta2!</h1>

<p>SaxonJS 3.0 is a major update to the SaxonJS product. In June 2025, we are
publishing a second preview release, version 3.0.0-beta2. This is a preview
release of the SaxonJS 3.0 HE (Home Edition) product. An EE (Enterprise Edition)
product is in the works.
</p>

<div>
<h2>New features in the beta2 release</h2>

<p>This release includes a few bug fixes from the first beta.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/5923">5923</a>
   Provide a way to control event listener parameters</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6599">6599</a>
   Sequence interacts badly with try/catch</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6697">6697</a>
   Checksum checking in SaxonJS 3</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6742">6742</a>
   Untethered promises with SaxonJS 3.0.0-beta1</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the most consequential is probably 6697. In the course of fixing a
bug related to SEF files produced for SaxonJS 2, we introduced a bug where
SaxonJ 12.6 couldn’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta1! That’s been fixed.
You can now produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with Saxon 12.6 or later.
(Unfortunately, you can’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with SaxonJ
12.5 or earlier!)

<h2>Issues resolved</h2>

<p>The substantial changes in this release are:</p>

<ol>
<li>We’ve returned to supporting JDK 8 in 12.7. The decision to move to JDK 11
in 12.6 was intentional, but perhaps too eager. Fair warning: it is very
unlikely that Saxon 13 will be released with support for JDK 8.</li>
<li>We worked around a bug that caused the SaxonC products to fail under X86 emulation
on Windows/ARM. (The bug is that Windows emulation doesn’t support some modern
instructions that GraalVM was generating. We worked around it by turning down some
GraalVM optimizations in that environment.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Issues in SaxonC</h3>

<p>In the SaxonC 12.6 release, we have included a compiled C++ API library
(.dll, .so, .dylib as appropriate) along with accompanying CMake files to
simplify integration into C++ applications. This is provided in addition to the
core SaxonC library, which continues to be cross-compiled using GraalVM.</p>

<p>To use SaxonC in a C++ project, users now only need the two compiled library
files and the header files—greatly reducing setup complexity. Integrating with a
project already using CMake is as simple as using FindPackage(SaxonCHE 12.6.0)
(Or SaxonCEE, or SaxonCPE, if using the EE or PE editions). A sample CMake
project is provided with the samples in the download ZIP.</p>

<p>This change applies only to the C++ API. It does not affect the PHP or Python extensions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>PHP</dt>
<dd>Installation instructions are included in the README file in the download
ZIP and also available in the online documentation.</dd>
<dt>Python</dt>
<dd>The extension is distributed as pre-built wheels via PyPI, making
installation straightforward using pip.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to the individual issues listed below, this release fixes a
number of multithreading issues, encoding problems, and memory leaks. API
support has been added for getcwd, getProperty/getProperties, and
getJustInTimeCompilation on several objects. There have also been a number
of documentation improvements.</p>

        <p>There's been a lot of discussion recently in the QT4 community group about introducing
        ordered maps: that is, maps in which there is a defined and predictable ordering of entries,
        typically "last-in, last-out" where the most recently added entry always appears at the end.
        The main motivation for this is that JSON is designed (like XML) to be human-readable, but
        JSON content in which the entries appear in random order is anything but: if a phone bill
        contains a name, address, account number, a summary of charges, and an itemized list of calls,
        then you don't want the phone number appearing in the middle, sandwiched between the
        list of calls and the list of charges. Currently when data is serialized as JSON, we provide
        an option to indent it for readability, but indentation isn't going to make the data readable if
        it's in random order.</p>
        
        <p>Retaining order is particularly useful for visual inspection of changes: if you write code that
        modifies one entry in a JSON document, you want to satisfy yourself that the transformation
        did exactly what you expected, and the best way to convince yourself is by placing the
        input and output side-by-side and comparing them visually.</p>
        
        <p>There seems to be consensus that support for ordered maps, at least in some circumstances,
        is desirable. There is debate about whether all maps should be ordered, and about whether
        ordering should be the default, and about whether ordering should be supported if a map
        is built incrementally using <code>map:put</code> operations. The answer to those questions
        depends at least in part on understanding how great the overhead is in retaining order
        in maps: if the overhead is negligible, then we might as well make all maps ordered.</p>
        
        <p>Normally I'm the first to argue that the language specification should not be driven
        by performance concerns: we should design a clean language and leave implementors to
        worry about how to implement it efficiently. But in this case, if we're making a change
        to the language semantics that affects users whether they want the feature or not, I think
        we need to understand clearly whether we are asking users to pay a performance price.</p>
        
        <p>Both JavaScript (from ES2015) and Python (from 3.7) have moved 
        in the direction of making all maps (objects/dictionaries) ordered, so we wouldn't 
        be on our own in doing this. However, JavaScript objects and Python dictionaries
        are mutable, whereas XDM maps are functionally persistent (adding an entry
        creates a new map, leaving the original unchanged), so the performance
        constraints are somewhat different.</p>
        
        <p>So let's look now at how Saxon implements maps.</p>
        
        <p>In SaxonJ 12.x there are two main implementations (ignoring special cases such as empty
        maps and singleton maps). The default implementation is in the class 
        <code>net.sf.saxon.ma.map.HashTrieMap</code>, and this is built using an open source
        implementation of immutable hash tries written by Michael Froh; it has been in the
        product since 9.6. In SaxonCS 12.x we replace this with the functionally equivalent Microsoft 
        class <code>System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableDictionary</code>. Both these library
        implementations are unordered.</p>
        
        <p>There is a minor tweak that complicates the implementation. In an ideal world,
        we would create an underlying map of type <code>Map&lt;AtomicValue, GroundedValue&gt;</code>,
        where <code>AtomicValue</code> is the Saxon class used to hold all atomic values,
        and <code>GroundedValue</code> is the Saxon class used to hold all sequences other than
        those that are lazily-evaluated. However, <code>AtomicValue.equals()</code> does
        not implement the equality semantics defined by XDM for comparing map keys. This
        is because XPath has different rules for equality comparisons in different circumstances.
        The Microsoft <code>ImmutableDictionary</code> can take a custom <code>KeyComparer</code>
        parameter, which would solve this problem, but there is no equivalent in the Froh
        library that we use in SaxonJ. So instead we implement an underlying map of type
        <code>Map&lt;AtomicMatchKey, Tuple&lt;AtomicValue, GroundedValue&gt;&gt;</code>, where
        <code>AtomicMatchKey</code> is a value derived from the <code>AtomicValue</code>
        that has the correct equality semantics. We need to hold the <code>AtomicValue</code>
        because in general two atomic values can have the same <code>AtomicMatchKey</code>
        (for example this is the case when the keys are a mix of different numeric types):
        and the XPath functionality for maps requires the original key value (including
        its type annotation) to be retained.</p>
        
        <p>The second implementation of maps found in SaxonJ and SaxonCS is the class
        <code>net.sf.saxon.ma.map.DictionaryMap</code>. This is implemented over a standard
        mutable <code>java.util.HashMap&lt;String, GroundedValue&gt;&gt;</code> on Java, or
        <code>System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;string, GroundedValue&gt;</code>
        on .NET. It is suitable only where the keys are all instances of <code>xs:string</code>
        (which means we don't need to retain the type annotation), and where no in-situ
        modification takes place. As soon as an operation such as <code>map:put</code>
        or <code>map:remove</code> is applied to the map, we make a copy using the
        more general <code>HashTrieMap</code> implementation. But for many maps,
        especially those derived from JSON parsing, incremental modification is rare,
        and the lower-overhead <code>DictionaryMap</code> is perfectly satisfactory.</p>
        
        <p>In Saxon 13 (not yet released), a third map implementation has been introduced:
        the <code>ShapedMap</code>. This is described in the article 
        <a href="https://blog.saxonica.com/mike/2024/08/maps-and-records.html">Maps and Records</a>,
        and it is particularly useful in cases where many maps have exactly the same structure.
        This often happens when parsing CSV or JSON files. A <code>ShapedMap</code> is in two
        parts: a <code>Shape</code> object which holds a mapping from keys to integer slot numbers,
        and a simple array of slots holding the values of the fields. The <code>Shape</code>
        object can be shared between all map instances having a common structure. As with the
        <code>DictionaryMap</code>, if a <code>ShapedMap</code> is subjected to <code>map:put</code>
        or <code>map:remove</code> operations, it is immediately copied to a <code>HashTrieMap</code>.</p>
        
        <p>How are these map implementations affected by the requirement to maintain order
        of entries?</p>
        
        <p>For the <code>ShapedMap</code>, order is already maintained, so it isn't a problem.
        The only impact is that two maps can only share the same <code>Shape</code> object
        if their keys are in the same order. There isn't going to be any observable performance
        regression.</p>
        
        <p>For the <code>DictionaryMap</code>, on the Java platform we can replace the
        underlying <code>HashMap&lt;String, GroundedValue&gt;</code> by a 
        <code>LinkedHashMap&lt;String, GroundedValue&gt;</code>. That's easily done,
        because it supports the same interface. I don't yet know how much overhead
        it imposes (in space or time); that requires some measurements.</p>
        
        <p>On .NET, unfortunately, there is no equivalent to Java's <code>LinkedHashMap</code>.
        I have therefore implemented my own: this comprises a <code>Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;</code>
        that maps string-valued keys to integer positions in the sequence, and two lists:
        a list of <code>AtomicValue</code> for the keys and a list of <code>GroundedValue</code>
        for the values.</p>
        
        <p>For the <code>HashTrieMap</code> on Java, my plan is to scrap the immutable map implemented
        by Michael Froh, and substitute it with the <code>io.vavr.collection.LinkedHashMap</code>
        from the VAVR library, which appears to have the required semantics. Again, there appears
        to be no direct equivalent on .NET, so a home grown solution is again called for. My
        current implementation uses the same apprach as for the <code>DictionaryMap</code>:
        an immutable unordered map from atomic keys to integers, supplemented by ordered 
        immutable lists of <code>AtomicValue</code> for the keys and <code>GroundedValue</code>
        for the values.</p>
        
        <p>Which brings us to the question, what are the overheads? Answering that question
        means making some assumptions about the workloads we want to measure. For example,
        how important are <code>map:put</code> and <code>map:remove</code> operations? 
        Anecdotal evidence suggests these are rather rare, and that most maps are read-only
        once built. But they might be important to some use cases.</p>
        
        <p>The other complication is that we might be able to mitigate the overheads of making
        maps ordered by introducing new optimisations. We've already introduced the 
        <code>ShapedMap</code> idea, where ordering hopefully imposes very little overhead.
        On .NET we could consider taking advantage of the ability to use a custom 
        <code>KeyComparer</code> to avoid the overhead of effectively storing the keys twice.</p>
        
        <p>We could also get smarter about choosing which implementation of maps to use under
        which circumstances. One change that I'm making is to introduce a <code>MapBuilder</code>
        class: during the initial construction of a map (for example during JSON parsing or
        during processing of <code>map:merge</code> or <code>map:build</code>, or during
        evaluation of a map constructor) we can add entries to a mutable builder object, and
        this then gives us the opportunity to choose the final map implementation when we
        know what all the keys and values are. For example, if all the keys have the same
        type annotation, then in principle we don't need to save the type annotations with
        every key value. We also know the size of the map at this stage.</p>
        
        <p>We can even go further and avoid indexing the map until the first lookup 
        (or <code>map:get</code>) operation. It might seem surprising, but there
        are many maps that are never used for lookup. For example, a JSON document
        might contain thousands of maps that are simply copied unchanged to the output,
        or that are discarded because they are irrelevant to the particular query.
        Perhaps the map builder should simply maintain a list of keys and values,
        and do nothing else until the first <code>map:get</code>? The only complication
        here is the need to detect duplicate keys, but that could be done cheaply
        using a Bloom filter.</p>
        
        <p>So we need to do some measurements. But there's a good chance that if
        it does turn out that ordered maps impose an overhead, we can find compensating
        optimisations that mean there's no regression on the bottom line.</p>
        
        <p>My first experiments looking at the cost of parsing and re-serializing
        JSON actually suggest that most of the cost is in the parsing and serializing,
        and that the choice of data structure for the XDM maps has very little impact 
        on the bottom line. But that's provisional and subject to confirmation.</p>

<p>SaxonJS 3.0 is a major update to the SaxonJS product. In December 2024, it is
being published as a preview release, version 3.0.0-beta1. This is a preview
release of the SaxonJS 3.0 HE (Home Edition) product. An EE (Enterprise Edition)
product is in the works.
</p>

<div>
<h2>New features in the beta1 release</h2>

<p>This release includes a number of new features, with several more planned
before the final 3.0 release.
</p>

<div>
<h3>Promises</h3>

<p>SaxonJS 3 introduces new mechanisms for enabling asynchronous processing
using promises. A new instruction <code>ixsl:promise</code> is introduced which
can be used as a replacement for the existing <code>ixsl:schedule-action</code>
instruction.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The new instruction can now call any asychronous function to fetch any kind of
resource. Adding new kinds of resource is just a question of implementing new
functions (which can be user-written functions as well as system-supplied
functions). So if you want to fetch data from a SQL database, for example, you
can easily write a function to do that.</li>
<li>The machinery for handling asynchronous requests is now closely aligned with
JavaScript promises, both in terms of the conceptual design, and the
implementation. This makes it much easier to understand for users familiar
with the JavaScript processing model.</li>
<li>The mechanism takes advantage of XDM higher-order functions. (Note, however,
that it still “bends” the pure declarative approach of XPath by introducing
mutability. A promise, for example, is a mutable object, so you need to
exercise care for example if you bind it to a variable.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that for Node.js, run time use of ixsl:promise is an EE feature. So XSLT
stylesheets using <code>ixsl:promise</code> can be compiled to SEF with the XX
compiler in SaxonJS without a JS-EE license, and then run in the browser; but to
run such a stylesheet on Node.js requires SaxonJS-EE and a valid JS-EE license.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>JavaScript extension functions</h3>

<p>JavaScript developers have easy access to a huge variety of tools and
libraries distributed as JavaScript packages through <code>npm</code> and other
mechanisms. We want to make those libraries easily accessible for SaxonJS
developers too.
</p>

<p>In SaxonJS 3, you can define extension functions in JavaScript and call them
directly from XPath, both from <code>SaxonJS.XPath.evaluate</code> and from
within XSLT stylesheets running on SaxonJS in the browser or on Node.js.
</p>

<p>This opens up whole new horizons for SaxonJS developers.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Smaller changes and improvements</h3>

<p>While a lot of our focus has been on larger improvements, a few less dramatic
features are also debuting in beta1.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Support XPath expressions (other than “.”) after ? in <code>xsl:result-document</code></li>
<li>New methods on <code>xsl:result-document</code>: <code>ixsl:replace-element</code>, <code>ixsl:insert-before</code>, and
<code>ixsl:insert-after</code></li>
<li>Improved support for following HTTP redirects</li>
<li>Improved support for accessing JavaScript objects with <code>ixsl:set-property</code>, <code>ixsl:json-parse</code>,
<code>ixsl:new</code>, <code>ixsl:apply</code>, <code>ixsl:call</code>, <code>ixsl:eval</code>, and <code>ixsl:get</code></li>
<li>Support the <code>escape-solidus</code> option when generating JSON.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h2>New features coming soon</h2>

<p>Eager to publish a release, at this stage, we’ve opted only to publish the HE
version of SaxonJS 3.0 as beta1. More work is planned before the general
release, including SaxonJS 3.0 EE.
</p>

<div>
<h3>SaxonJS-EE</h3>

<p>SaxonJS-HE will remain a free product, but in 2025 we will also be introducing a
licensed version of SaxonJS, SaxonJS-EE. The licensed version will provide additional
features on Node.js (such as built-in EXPath and Saxon extension functions).
</p>

<p>The promises API run time will be a licensed feature on Node.js.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Calling XSLT functions from JavaScript</h3>

<p>Many transformations, on XML and JSON, are easier to define in XSLT than in
JavaScript. XSLT has a rich vocabulary of instructions for describing, constructing,
and transforming data in a clear, descriptive, and functional way.
</p>

<p>We anticipate making those features more accessible to JavaScript developers by
allowing JavaScript to call functions defined in XSLT.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Adding a SaxonJS.compile API</h3>

<p>The ability to construct an XSLT stylesheet and then compile it directly for
use in the current transformation is a powerful feature. A new API for doing this,
<code>SaxonJS.compile</code>, will be added in the general release.
</p>
</div>

<p>As some of you have noticed, the SaxonJS
“<a href="../../2023/10/06-no-longer-supported.html">no longer supported</a>” bug
returned a few days ago. I’d have sworn that I removed that warning when we shipped
SaxonJS 2.6. But I’d also have sworn we would get 3.0 out before now. Maybe I’m
not very good at swearing.</p>

<p>That warning <em>has been</em> removed from
<a href="../../../announcements/2024/10/saxonjs-2.7.html">SaxonJS 2.7</a>, so
this issue won’t surface again next October.</p>

<p>Apologies for not getting a maintenance release out sooner. We really should
have. Focus has been on SaxonJS 3.0, which is still coming along nicely, but
there were a number of bug fixes in SaxonJS 2.x that we could have shipped
months ago.</p>

<p>My expectation is that we’ll ship some sort of beta test version of SaxonJS
3.0 “real soon now” and Saxon 12.6 to fix
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6487">the SEF bug</a> in 12.5 shortly
before or after that.

<p>Over the years, there have been several requests to improve the way that
SaxonJS is packaged for the browser. In the run up towards SaxonJS 3.0 (real
soon now, I promise), I’ve spent a few hours trying to see if that’s possible.</p>

<p>For SaxonJS on Node.js, things seem to be working the way users expect. You
can install SaxonJS, and <em>xslt3.js</em>, the command-line XSLT processor,
with <code>npm install</code>. Then you can use them as you would other Node.js
modules and applications.</p>

<p>For the browser, things are a little less clear.</p>

<p>I’ll start out by observing that SaxonJS is a large(ish) collection of mostly
plain JavaScript files. There are a mixture of techniques used, as you might
expect from a code base that stretches back seven or eight years (roughly ∞ in
JavaScript years). This code is compiled by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">Closure Compiler</a> to
produce the release artifacts.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p><em>Aside:</em> Producing TypeScript instead of JavaScript is almost certainly
impractical. And
the answer to the question, “can you make it an ESM module?” appears to be “no”. But
maybe I’m wrong?</p>
</div>

<p>Almost anything is <em>possible</em> in software,
but there some things are probably <em>impractical</em> because of how SaxonJS
is built.
</p>

<p>What I’ve come to realize after several hours is that I
don’t actually understand what problem I’m trying to solve. That usually makes
problems harder.</p>

<p>For example, it would be easy to package the browser versions of the SaxonJS
libraries into the <code>saxon-js</code> <em>npm</em> package. That would allow
you to use <code>npm install</code> to install it. Once installed, you could
refer to it in HTML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="node_modules/saxon-js/SaxonJS3.rt.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>That’s a non-zero usability improvement over downloading the browser release
yourself and adding it to your project, but it’s an <em>awfully small</em>
improvement. So small, that I conjecture that the request to “put it in the npm
package” means more than that. But I don’t know what more.</p>

<p>Another request that’s come up a couple of times is whether we should provide
a version that’s been packaged up with <em>webpack</em>. Well. Okay. I spent
a bit of time on that and eventually I managed to get</p>

<pre><code>npx webpack --config webpack.config.js</code></pre>

<p>to take <code>src/SaxonJS3.js</code>, chew on it for a while, and produce
<code>dist/SaxonJS3.js</code>. That was a little, uh, underwhelming. I started
with a JavaScript library that I could load in the browser and ended with…a
different one, I guess?</p>

<p>Then there are suggestions that instead of <em>webpack</em> I should be
trying <em>vite</em> or <em>bun</em> or something else and do I also need
<em>browserify</em>? I don’t know.
I’m about to give up, at least in the short term, but before I do, I thought
I’d see if anyone out there can tell me what I’m missing.</p>

<p>If you would like to see SaxonJS for the browser packaged up in some
different way, can you tell me how? And why? A small test case would be ideal:
something that isn’t too complicated, that doesn’t work with SaxonJS as it’s
distributed today, that would work if we packaged it in some other way.</p>

        <p>Maps have proved to be one of the most powerful new features in the 3.0/3.1 family of standards,
        and records, which extend the capability will probably prove one of the most powerful in 4.0. 
        Under the name <i>tuple types</i>, the feature has been available as a proprietary Saxon extension
        since Saxon 9.8, which came out on the same day as the XSLT 3.0 Recommendation in June 2017.
        The feature is now well established, but the details are still being refined.</p>
        
        <p>A record type is declared like this:</p>
        
        <pre>record(longitude as xs:double, latitude as xs:double)</pre>
        
        <p>A record type is simply a new way of constraining maps; the instances of the type
        are maps (in this case a map with two entries, one with key "longitude" and one with
        key "latitude"). You can use a record type to declare the types of variables and function
        arguments, but the actual value of the variable is a map, and all the standard map operations
        are available, such as the lookup operator: <code>$location?longitude</code>.</p>
        
        <p>We're working on an extension that allows named record types to be declared globally:</p>
        
        <pre>&lt;xsl:record name="my:location"&gt;
   &lt;xsl:field name="longitude" as="xs:double"/&gt;
   &lt;xsl:field name="latitude" as="xs:double"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:record&gt;</pre>
        
        <p>which would also give you a constructor function: <code>my:location($long, $lat)</code>.</p>
        
        <p>The main thing I want to talk about in this article is how records can be efficiently
        implemented.</p>
        
        <p>Until recently, a record type simply constrained the contents of a map, and had no
        bearing on the way the map was implemented.</p>
        
        <p>Internally, Saxon represents maps using the interface <code>net.sf.saxon.ma.map.MapItem</code>
        (actually an abstract class), and there are several implementations of this interface:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><code>EmptyMap</code> for an empty map</li>
            <li><code>SingleEntryMap</code> for a map with one entry, such as the map created by <code>map:entry()</code></li>
            <li><code>DictionaryMap</code> for a map whose keys are all strings, and that isn't likely to be modified
            (for example maps derived by parsing JSON, or maps written using literal constructors as option parameter values)</li>
            <li><code>HashTrieMap</code> as the general implementation that handles everything.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For the next release, Saxon 13, we've written a new implementation called a
        <i>ShapedMap</i>. There are two parts to this: a <i>Shape</i> is a mapping from field names to
        integer slot numbers, and a <i>ShapedMap</i> is a reference to a <i>Shape</i>, plus an array of slots.
        So it's great where you have many maps with exactly the same structure, because you only hold the keys
        once.</p>
        
        <p>So far we're mainly using shaped maps where the structure of the map is defined by the language specification,
        for example for the key-value pairs returned by <code>map:pairs()</code>, for the results of functions such as
        <code>parse-csv()</code>, <code>random-number-generator()</code>, and <code>load-xquery-module()</code>,
        and for the labels attached to values by the new deep-lookup operator (plenty of scope there for future articles).
        I would love to use them also for the result of <code>parse-json()</code> if we can detect the common case
        of a JSON file containing thousands of maps (JSON objects) with exactly the same structure. And of course, once
        we have record constructor functions as described above, they are an obvious candidate for the result
        of such a function.</p>
        
        <p>Shaped maps immediately give a space saving because the keys and their hash index are shared between instances.
        The next challenge after that is to make lookup on shaped maps more efficient. Given a lookup expression
        such as <code>$location?longitude</code>, we <i>ought</i> to be able to extract the corresponding value directly
        from slot 0 of the <code>ShapedMap</code> object, without the overhead of doing a run-time hash lookup of the string
        <code>"longitude"</code> in the corresponding <code>Shape</code> in order to establish that this field is always
        in slot 0.</p>
        
        <p>The obvious, classic way of doing that is through static type inference: if we know the static type of the
        <code>$location</code> variable, then we can know at compile time what the mapping of field names to slots will be,
        and can generate an execution plan accordingly.</p>
        
        <p>But I'm becoming a bit disillusioned with relying on static type analysis. Users, in general, are lazy: they
        want good performance without doing extra work, like declaring the types of all their variables. That's particularly
        true when you start writing code that relies heavily on higher-order functions, which we want to encourage.
        So I'm looking increasingly at options that decide the execution plan at run-time, modifying it in the light
        of actual experience. Given an expression like <code>$location?longitude</code> that is executed repeatedly,
        the chances are that if <code>$location</code> is a shaped map with <code>longitude</code> in slot 0 on one occasion,
        then the same will be true next time you execute the same expression.</p>
        
        <p>We've quietly introduced this kind of approach in recent releases, and it's working well. For example, with
        lazy evaluation of variables and function results we now use a learning approach: we start with lazy evaluation,
        but if on the first 20 executions the value is immediately read to completion, we switch to eager evaluation.
        That's because lazy evaluation has a significant set-up overhead to retain the parts of the context on which the
        expression depends, and there is no benefit in doing this if the caller is going to immediately materialise
        the value anyway.</p>
        
        <p>The concrete design for shaped record access goes something like this. We augment the 
            <code>MapItem</code> interface with a method
        <code>map.lookup(key, plan)</code>. This method returns the requested value from the map, but also updates the
        value of <code>plan</code> with information that will be retained the next time the same expression is evaluated.
        If the map is a shaped map, the returned plan can include the <code>Shape</code> and the slot number; if an incoming
        request comes with a plan that identifies the same <code>Shape</code> (which it usually will), 
        then we can access the relevant slot number directly,
        ignoring the value of the key. That only works, of course, for a lookup expression where the key is a literal
        constant; but that's the normal case when working with records.</p>
        
        <p>If we can make this work (and it seems straightforward), then the same approach might have other applications.
        For example, can we make path expressions go faster if we optimize for the tree model in use? Or could we get rid
        of statically-allocated fingerprints (with the inconvenience they cause by not allowing documents and stylesheets
        to be shared across configurations), and instead have the expression discover the fingerprint and NamePool at 
        execution time?</p>
        
        <p>Saxon is now 25 years old. It seems there are still plenty of exciting ways to make it better.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonC 12.4.2!</h1>

<p>A SaxonC 12.4.2 maintenance release has been published. This
release fixes several issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6197">6197</a> A segmentation fault in the PHP extension</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6273">6273</a> A change in the way whitespace is handled in filenames</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6274">6274</a> An problem with the “encoding” keyword in the python saxon processor</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6277">6277</a> A build configuration issue for the SaxonC HE Python processor</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6288">6288</a> A build issue for the SaxonC PHP extension</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6294">6294</a> A segmentation fault parsing JSON</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6301">6301</a> A compile error related to memory allocation with some C++ compilers</li>
<!--
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6304">6304</a> An issue when using multiple threads from the Python processor</li>
-->
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6306">6306</a> Unreleased memory in the Python processor</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6324">6324</a>  A segmentation fault in the Python extension</li>
</ul>

<p>Some efforts have also been made to improve the way dynamic
libraries are referenced when using the C/C++ APIs directly. These
changes are reflected in the builds and in the scripts that compile
the “command” and “samples” applications.</p>

<p>In brief: on macOS, the dynamic library can be accessed through
<code>@rpath</code> and on Linux, the dynamic library can be placed in a standard
location or accessed with the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.
On Windows, apparently the standard practice is to place the DLL in the same
directory as the executable.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonC 12.4.1!</h1>

<p>A SaxonC 12.4.1 maintenance release has been published. This
release fixes <a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6268">a build
error</a> on the Windows platform and includes one additional
patch.</p>

<p>I’m an ardent believer in build automation and reproducibility
through scripting. We’ve made a lot of progress in this area, but
Windows is still a bit “hands on.” Problem is, it was my hands and I
messed up.</p>

<p>A while back, we considered upgrading to a newer version of
GraalVM. In the course of testing that, I upgraded the version on the
Windows build machine. But ultimately, we decided not to make that
upgrade.</p>

<p>Despite having an explicit note in my release checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>☑ Check the version of GraalVM</li>
</ul>

<p>I missed it on the Windows box. A lot of good detective work went
into trying to figure out what was going on, but in the end, just
building with the “right” version of GraalVM fixed it. Apologies to
the team and everyone else for that.</p>

<p>The 12.4.1 release also includes a
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6182">partial fix</a> for
issues relating to UTF-8 string-based C API functions. Unfortunately,
a more complete fix was deemed too risky for what was otherwise an
“emergency” release. That fix will have to wait for next time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TL;DR</a>, you can
ignore the message.</p>

<p>Several folks have noticed that, since about yesterday, if you run
the SaxonJS 2.5 <code>xslt3</code> Node.js command line processor, it
prints a scary “no longer supported” message.</p>

<p>Sorry. Our bad. The message is only informative and has no effect
on the performance of the processor.</p>

<p>We support SaxonJS releases for at least a year and a while back
(far enough back that I can’t easily determine when from the
repository history), we confidently assumed that we’d always do a
release at least once a year. So when you got that message, it was to
encourage you to upgrade.</p>

<p>Except this year, we published a whole bunch of other releases,
embarked on SaxonJS 3.0, shifted our web infrastructure around, and
did a bunch of other things. What we didn’t do was publish SaxonJS 3.0
within a year, and because we were heads-down on that, we didn’t
notice that we hadn’t published a SaxonJS 2.6 release within a year
either.</p>

<p>(It’s all a little embarrassing.)</p>

<p>We’ve fixed a handful of bugs in SaxonJS 2.5 since we shipped it,
and we’ve identified a slightly larger handful that we’d like to
consider fixing before we ship a SaxonJS 2.6 release. But we will ship
it, as quickly as practical.</p>

<p>As <a href="/mike/2023/10/eot.html">Mike says</a>, today is a big
day. It is an honour to be able to announce that I am taking on a new
role as CEO of Saxonica.</p>

<p>Let me start by offering huge congratulations and thanks to Mike and
Penny Kay, whose talent, commitment, and hard work have made Saxonica
into the successful company it is today.</p>

<p>I’m happy (and somewhat relieved!) to say that the Saxonica team
will continue to benefit from Mike’s experience for the foreseeable
future, as he moves to a new role as Director of Innovation. Working
part-time, Mike will continue to support customers and colleagues
alike, as well as ensuring that his in-depth knowledge of our code
base continues to be passed on to the rest of the Saxonica engineering
team, myself included!</p>

<p>Before I had the opportunity to join the company in 2020, I was
already an enthusiastic part of Saxonica’s user base. I know how
important our products are to our users; I <em>am</em> one of our users!</p>

<p>Working with this team of talented people to develop software that
makes a real contribution to the XML community has been a privilege.
Becoming Saxonica’s CEO is an even greater one. I am committed to
seeing Saxonica grow and prosper into the next decades, continuing the
reputation for excellence, innovation, and community-mindedness that
Mike has worked so hard to establish.</p>

        <p>Today we are announcing a big change at Saxonica, but it's one 
            that we hope no-one will notice.</p>
        
        <p>Some of you may have noticed that I will be 72 in a couple of weeks, 
        and you may have been wondering how long I intended to continue. 
        Well, I'm still enjoying the challenge, and I'm not giving up just yet, 
        but I have been thinking for some time about how to move the company 
        into a position where it can thrive without me. I decided a while ago 
        that the best approach — in the interests of the staff and the user community — 
        was to move the ownership of the company into an Employee Ownership Trust, 
        and this has now been effected.</p>
        
        <p>What this means is that Saxonica is now owned by a Trust, which 
        has acquired a 100% shareholding from my wife Penny and myself. 
        The Trustees are Norm Tovey-Walsh, Sue Schreiber, and myself, and their 
        task is to appoint directors and approve any big decisions (such as 
        acquisitions). When making such decisions the Trust is obliged to 
        take into consideration the best interests of the staff and the user 
        community, including both paying customers and open-source users.</p>
        
        <p>Indeed, there's a specific clause in the trust deed noting that the company's
        software is used to deliver open data for the wider benefit of society at large,
        and the Trustees are required to take this into account.</p>
        
        <p>The most obvious change will be that Norm Tovey-Walsh is taking over as Chief Executive; 
        I will remain on the board (with the title "Director of Innovation"), 
        but Norm is now the boss. I can't think of anyone in the world who 
        is better qualified to steer the ship.</p>
        
        <p>Back at the start of 2020, before the pandemic, I was rather conscious that
        with several people approaching retirement age,
        the company was not in a good state to carry on without me; as a result any 
        acquisition could well have led to serious discontinuity for the user community, 
        and indeed for the future of the XML ecosystem of which we have become such 
        a central part. Since then, with Norm joining in a senior technical role, 
        with Ankita Mohinta taking over the marketing and commercial side so effectively, 
        and more recently with Matt Patterson joining O'Neil Delpratt and Debbie Lockett 
        on the development side, we now have a team that has an unmatched depth of talent. 
        This is reflected in excellent financial results over the last couple of years. 
        But it's also true that I know the innards of the software better than anyone, 
        and I don't intend to walk away from my focus on providing technical support 
        to customers, which is probably the part of the job that I enjoy the most.</p>
        
        <p>Penny is taking this opportunity to retire from her role as a director 
        and employee of the company, and this is a good opportunity to thank 
        her for her contribution. She may not have been very visible externally, 
        but she's done a lot of invaluable admin work behind the scenes, 
        and has been a constant source of good advice, most particularly 
        in helping to build a happy and productive team — especially 
        through the pandemic.</p>
        
        <p>I'm confident that through this adminstrative change, the company will 
        retain the core values that have been central to our success: innovation, 
        commitment to standards, outstanding technical support, honesty and integrity, 
        admitting to our mistakes when we make them, and above all being active 
        contributors to the thriving community without which we would not exist. 
        I hope to remain part of that for many years to come.</p>
