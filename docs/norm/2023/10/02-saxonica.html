<p>As <a href="/mike/2023/10/eot.html">Mike says</a>, today is a big
day. It is an honour to be able to announce that I am taking on a new
role as CEO of Saxonica.</p>

<p>Let me start by offering huge congratulations and thanks to Mike and
Penny Kay, whose talent, commitment, and hard work have made Saxonica
into the successful company it is today.</p>

<p>I’m happy (and somewhat relieved!) to say that the Saxonica team
will continue to benefit from Mike’s experience for the foreseeable
future, as he moves to a new role as Director of Innovation. Working
part-time, Mike will continue to support customers and colleagues
alike, as well as ensuring that his in-depth knowledge of our code
base continues to be passed on to the rest of the Saxonica engineering
team, myself included!</p>

<p>Before I had the opportunity to join the company in 2020, I was
already an enthusiastic part of Saxonica’s user base. I know how
important our products are to our users; I <em>am</em> one of our users!</p>

<p>Working with this team of talented people to develop software that
makes a real contribution to the XML community has been a privilege.
Becoming Saxonica’s CEO is an even greater one. I am committed to
seeing Saxonica grow and prosper into the next decades, continuing the
reputation for excellence, innovation, and community-mindedness that
Mike has worked so hard to establish.</p>
