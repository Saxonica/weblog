<p>The accompanying release announcements for
<a href="saxon-11.7.html">Saxon 11.7</a> and
<a href="saxon-12.8.html">Saxon 12.8</a> describe those
releases in detail. This post summarizes why we decided that we
needed to release them both this week.</p>

<p>Some applications are known to use Saxon to run untrusted, user-submitted
stylesheets or queries. Running untrusted code always entails some risk. Saxon
provides two
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!configuration/config-features">features</a>
designed to help mitigate this risk: <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> and

<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code>. Setting <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code>
can limit what resources a stylesheet or query can access; it can for example,
forbid access to file: URIs. The <code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature
can disable access to reflexive Java extension functions, some system
properties, and some other extension functions. (The remit of the
<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature is a little wider than you might
expect.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we discovered a function in Saxon 11 and 12 that was not
adequately controlled by these features. In principle, a stylesheet or query
running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE could access the local filesystem even if the
<code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> feature was set to forbid such access. The risk
is small: it only applies to untrusted code running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE (it
does not apply to Saxon-HE) on a system where reading from the local filesystem
would be deemed a risk. (We would encourage anyone running untrusted code to use
a sandboxed environment where there is no data on the filesystem that needs to
be protected from read access.)</p>

<p>Although we judge the risk to be small, At Saxonica, we take security
seriously and we are publishing maintenance releases of Saxon 11 and Saxon 12 to
close this gap. We urge anyone running untrusted stylesheets or queries under
Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE to move to version 11.7 or 12.8 immediately.</p>

<p>This bug is present in the Java, C#, C, C++, Python and PHP products. It is
not present in Saxon 10 (including the Saxon.NET 10) or in earlier releases. It
is not present in SaxonJS.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonJS-HE 3.0.0-beta2!</h1>

<p>SaxonJS 3.0 is a major update to the SaxonJS product. In June 2025, we are
publishing a second preview release, version 3.0.0-beta2. This is a preview
release of the SaxonJS 3.0 HE (Home Edition) product. An EE (Enterprise Edition)
product is in the works.
</p>

<div>
<h2>New features in the beta2 release</h2>

<p>This release includes a few bug fixes from the first beta.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/5923">5923</a>
   Provide a way to control event listener parameters</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6599">6599</a>
   Sequence interacts badly with try/catch</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6697">6697</a>
   Checksum checking in SaxonJS 3</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6742">6742</a>
   Untethered promises with SaxonJS 3.0.0-beta1</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the most consequential is probably 6697. In the course of fixing a
bug related to SEF files produced for SaxonJS 2, we introduced a bug where
SaxonJ 12.6 couldn’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta1! That’s been fixed.
You can now produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with Saxon 12.6 or later.
(Unfortunately, you can’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with SaxonJ
12.5 or earlier!)

<h2>Issues resolved</h2>

<p>The substantial changes in this release are:</p>

<ol>
<li>We’ve returned to supporting JDK 8 in 12.7. The decision to move to JDK 11
in 12.6 was intentional, but perhaps too eager. Fair warning: it is very
unlikely that Saxon 13 will be released with support for JDK 8.</li>
<li>We worked around a bug that caused the SaxonC products to fail under X86 emulation
on Windows/ARM. (The bug is that Windows emulation doesn’t support some modern
instructions that GraalVM was generating. We worked around it by turning down some
GraalVM optimizations in that environment.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Issues in SaxonC</h3>

<p>In the SaxonC 12.6 release, we have included a compiled C++ API library
(.dll, .so, .dylib as appropriate) along with accompanying CMake files to
simplify integration into C++ applications. This is provided in addition to the
core SaxonC library, which continues to be cross-compiled using GraalVM.</p>

<p>To use SaxonC in a C++ project, users now only need the two compiled library
files and the header files—greatly reducing setup complexity. Integrating with a
project already using CMake is as simple as using FindPackage(SaxonCHE 12.6.0)
(Or SaxonCEE, or SaxonCPE, if using the EE or PE editions). A sample CMake
project is provided with the samples in the download ZIP.</p>

<p>This change applies only to the C++ API. It does not affect the PHP or Python extensions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>PHP</dt>
<dd>Installation instructions are included in the README file in the download
ZIP and also available in the online documentation.</dd>
<dt>Python</dt>
<dd>The extension is distributed as pre-built wheels via PyPI, making
installation straightforward using pip.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to the individual issues listed below, this release fixes a
number of multithreading issues, encoding problems, and memory leaks. API
support has been added for getcwd, getProperty/getProperties, and
getJustInTimeCompilation on several objects. There have also been a number
of documentation improvements.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonJS-HE 3.0.0-beta1!</h1>

<p>SaxonJS 3.0 is a major update to the SaxonJS product. In December 2024, it is
being published as a preview release, version 3.0.0-beta1. This is a preview
release of the SaxonJS 3.0 HE (Home Edition) product. An EE (Enterprise Edition)
product is in the works.
</p>

<div>
<h2>New features in the beta1 release</h2>

<p>This release includes a number of new features, with several more planned
before the final 3.0 release.
</p>

<div>
<h3>Promises</h3>

<p>SaxonJS 3 introduces new mechanisms for enabling asynchronous processing
using promises. A new instruction <code>ixsl:promise</code> is introduced which
can be used as a replacement for the existing <code>ixsl:schedule-action</code>
instruction.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The new instruction can now call any asychronous function to fetch any kind of
resource. Adding new kinds of resource is just a question of implementing new
functions (which can be user-written functions as well as system-supplied
functions). So if you want to fetch data from a SQL database, for example, you
can easily write a function to do that.</li>
<li>The machinery for handling asynchronous requests is now closely aligned with
JavaScript promises, both in terms of the conceptual design, and the
implementation. This makes it much easier to understand for users familiar
with the JavaScript processing model.</li>
<li>The mechanism takes advantage of XDM higher-order functions. (Note, however,
that it still “bends” the pure declarative approach of XPath by introducing
mutability. A promise, for example, is a mutable object, so you need to
exercise care for example if you bind it to a variable.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that for Node.js, run time use of ixsl:promise is an EE feature. So XSLT
stylesheets using <code>ixsl:promise</code> can be compiled to SEF with the XX
compiler in SaxonJS without a JS-EE license, and then run in the browser; but to
run such a stylesheet on Node.js requires SaxonJS-EE and a valid JS-EE license.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>JavaScript extension functions</h3>

<p>JavaScript developers have easy access to a huge variety of tools and
libraries distributed as JavaScript packages through <code>npm</code> and other
mechanisms. We want to make those libraries easily accessible for SaxonJS
developers too.
</p>

<p>In SaxonJS 3, you can define extension functions in JavaScript and call them
directly from XPath, both from <code>SaxonJS.XPath.evaluate</code> and from
within XSLT stylesheets running on SaxonJS in the browser or on Node.js.
</p>

<p>This opens up whole new horizons for SaxonJS developers.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Smaller changes and improvements</h3>

<p>While a lot of our focus has been on larger improvements, a few less dramatic
features are also debuting in beta1.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Support XPath expressions (other than “.”) after ? in <code>xsl:result-document</code></li>
<li>New methods on <code>xsl:result-document</code>: <code>ixsl:replace-element</code>, <code>ixsl:insert-before</code>, and
<code>ixsl:insert-after</code></li>
<li>Improved support for following HTTP redirects</li>
<li>Improved support for accessing JavaScript objects with <code>ixsl:set-property</code>, <code>ixsl:json-parse</code>,
<code>ixsl:new</code>, <code>ixsl:apply</code>, <code>ixsl:call</code>, <code>ixsl:eval</code>, and <code>ixsl:get</code></li>
<li>Support the <code>escape-solidus</code> option when generating JSON.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h2>New features coming soon</h2>

<p>Eager to publish a release, at this stage, we’ve opted only to publish the HE
version of SaxonJS 3.0 as beta1. More work is planned before the general
release, including SaxonJS 3.0 EE.
</p>

<div>
<h3>SaxonJS-EE</h3>

<p>SaxonJS-HE will remain a free product, but in 2025 we will also be introducing a
licensed version of SaxonJS, SaxonJS-EE. The licensed version will provide additional
features on Node.js (such as built-in EXPath and Saxon extension functions).
</p>

<p>The promises API run time will be a licensed feature on Node.js.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Calling XSLT functions from JavaScript</h3>

<p>Many transformations, on XML and JSON, are easier to define in XSLT than in
JavaScript. XSLT has a rich vocabulary of instructions for describing, constructing,
and transforming data in a clear, descriptive, and functional way.
</p>

<p>We anticipate making those features more accessible to JavaScript developers by
allowing JavaScript to call functions defined in XSLT.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Adding a SaxonJS.compile API</h3>

<p>The ability to construct an XSLT stylesheet and then compile it directly for
use in the current transformation is a powerful feature. A new API for doing this,
<code>SaxonJS.compile</code>, will be added in the general release.
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>As some of you have noticed, the SaxonJS
“<a href="../../2023/10/06-no-longer-supported.html">no longer supported</a>” bug
returned a few days ago. I’d have sworn that I removed that warning when we shipped
SaxonJS 2.6. But I’d also have sworn we would get 3.0 out before now. Maybe I’m
not very good at swearing.</p>

<p>That warning <em>has been</em> removed from
<a href="../../../announcements/2024/10/saxonjs-2.7.html">SaxonJS 2.7</a>, so
this issue won’t surface again next October.</p>

<p>Apologies for not getting a maintenance release out sooner. We really should
have. Focus has been on SaxonJS 3.0, which is still coming along nicely, but
there were a number of bug fixes in SaxonJS 2.x that we could have shipped
months ago.</p>

<p>My expectation is that we’ll ship some sort of beta test version of SaxonJS
3.0 “real soon now” and Saxon 12.6 to fix
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6487">the SEF bug</a> in 12.5 shortly
before or after that.

<p>Over the years, there have been several requests to improve the way that
SaxonJS is packaged for the browser. In the run up towards SaxonJS 3.0 (real
soon now, I promise), I’ve spent a few hours trying to see if that’s possible.</p>

<p>For SaxonJS on Node.js, things seem to be working the way users expect. You
can install SaxonJS, and <em>xslt3.js</em>, the command-line XSLT processor,
with <code>npm install</code>. Then you can use them as you would other Node.js
modules and applications.</p>

<p>For the browser, things are a little less clear.</p>

<p>I’ll start out by observing that SaxonJS is a large(ish) collection of mostly
plain JavaScript files. There are a mixture of techniques used, as you might
expect from a code base that stretches back seven or eight years (roughly ∞ in
JavaScript years). This code is compiled by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">Closure Compiler</a> to
produce the release artifacts.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p><em>Aside:</em> Producing TypeScript instead of JavaScript is almost certainly
impractical. And
the answer to the question, “can you make it an ESM module?” appears to be “no”. But
maybe I’m wrong?</p>
</div>

<p>Almost anything is <em>possible</em> in software,
but there some things are probably <em>impractical</em> because of how SaxonJS
is built.
</p>

<p>What I’ve come to realize after several hours is that I
don’t actually understand what problem I’m trying to solve. That usually makes
problems harder.</p>

<p>For example, it would be easy to package the browser versions of the SaxonJS
libraries into the <code>saxon-js</code> <em>npm</em> package. That would allow
you to use <code>npm install</code> to install it. Once installed, you could
refer to it in HTML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="node_modules/saxon-js/SaxonJS3.rt.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>That’s a non-zero usability improvement over downloading the browser release
yourself and adding it to your project, but it’s an <em>awfully small</em>
improvement. So small, that I conjecture that the request to “put it in the npm
package” means more than that. But I don’t know what more.</p>

<p>Another request that’s come up a couple of times is whether we should provide
a version that’s been packaged up with <em>webpack</em>. Well. Okay. I spent
a bit of time on that and eventually I managed to get</p>

<pre><code>npx webpack --config webpack.config.js</code></pre>

<p>to take <code>src/SaxonJS3.js</code>, chew on it for a while, and produce
<code>dist/SaxonJS3.js</code>. That was a little, uh, underwhelming. I started
with a JavaScript library that I could load in the browser and ended with…a
different one, I guess?</p>

<p>Then there are suggestions that instead of <em>webpack</em> I should be
trying <em>vite</em> or <em>bun</em> or something else and do I also need
<em>browserify</em>? I don’t know.
I’m about to give up, at least in the short term, but before I do, I thought
I’d see if anyone out there can tell me what I’m missing.</p>

<p>If you would like to see SaxonJS for the browser packaged up in some
different way, can you tell me how? And why? A small test case would be ideal:
something that isn’t too complicated, that doesn’t work with SaxonJS as it’s
distributed today, that would work if we packaged it in some other way.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonC 12.4.2!</h1>

<p>A SaxonC 12.4.2 maintenance release has been published. This

</ul>

<p>Some efforts have also been made to improve the way dynamic
libraries are referenced when using the C/C++ APIs directly. These
changes are reflected in the builds and in the scripts that compile
the “command” and “samples” applications.</p>

<p>In brief: on macOS, the dynamic library can be accessed through
<code>@rpath</code> and on Linux, the dynamic library can be placed in a standard
location or accessed with the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.
On Windows, apparently the standard practice is to place the DLL in the same
directory as the executable.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonC 12.4.1!</h1>

<p>A SaxonC 12.4.1 maintenance release has been published. This
release fixes <a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6268">a build
error</a> on the Windows platform and includes one additional
patch.</p>

<p>I’m an ardent believer in build automation and reproducibility
through scripting. We’ve made a lot of progress in this area, but
Windows is still a bit “hands on.” Problem is, it was my hands and I
messed up.</p>

<p>A while back, we considered upgrading to a newer version of
GraalVM. In the course of testing that, I upgraded the version on the
Windows build machine. But ultimately, we decided not to make that
upgrade.</p>

<p>Despite having an explicit note in my release checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>☑ Check the version of GraalVM</li>
</ul>

<p>I missed it on the Windows box. A lot of good detective work went
into trying to figure out what was going on, but in the end, just
building with the “right” version of GraalVM fixed it. Apologies to
the team and everyone else for that.</p>

<p>The 12.4.1 release also includes a
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6182">partial fix</a> for
issues relating to UTF-8 string-based C API functions. Unfortunately,
a more complete fix was deemed too risky for what was otherwise an
“emergency” release. That fix will have to wait for next time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TL;DR</a>, you can
ignore the message.</p>

<p>Several folks have noticed that, since about yesterday, if you run
the SaxonJS 2.5 <code>xslt3</code> Node.js command line processor, it
prints a scary “no longer supported” message.</p>

<p>Sorry. Our bad. The message is only informative and has no effect
on the performance of the processor.</p>

<p>We support SaxonJS releases for at least a year and a while back
(far enough back that I can’t easily determine when from the
repository history), we confidently assumed that we’d always do a
release at least once a year. So when you got that message, it was to
encourage you to upgrade.</p>

<p>Except this year, we published a whole bunch of other releases,
embarked on SaxonJS 3.0, shifted our web infrastructure around, and
did a bunch of other things. What we didn’t do was publish SaxonJS 3.0
within a year, and because we were heads-down on that, we didn’t
notice that we hadn’t published a SaxonJS 2.6 release within a year
either.</p>

<p>(It’s all a little embarrassing.)</p>

<p>We’ve fixed a handful of bugs in SaxonJS 2.5 since we shipped it,
and we’ve identified a slightly larger handful that we’d like to
consider fixing before we ship a SaxonJS 2.6 release. But we will ship
it, as quickly as practical.</p>

<p>As <a href="/mike/2023/10/eot.html">Mike says</a>, today is a big
day. It is an honour to be able to announce that I am taking on a new
role as CEO of Saxonica.</p>

<p>Let me start by offering huge congratulations and thanks to Mike and
Penny Kay, whose talent, commitment, and hard work have made Saxonica
into the successful company it is today.</p>

<p>I’m happy (and somewhat relieved!) to say that the Saxonica team
will continue to benefit from Mike’s experience for the foreseeable
future, as he moves to a new role as Director of Innovation. Working
part-time, Mike will continue to support customers and colleagues
alike, as well as ensuring that his in-depth knowledge of our code
base continues to be passed on to the rest of the Saxonica engineering
team, myself included!</p>

<p>Before I had the opportunity to join the company in 2020, I was
already an enthusiastic part of Saxonica’s user base. I know how
important our products are to our users; I <em>am</em> one of our users!</p>

<p>Working with this team of talented people to develop software that
makes a real contribution to the XML community has been a privilege.
Becoming Saxonica’s CEO is an even greater one. I am committed to
seeing Saxonica grow and prosper into the next decades, continuing the
reputation for excellence, innovation, and community-mindedness that
Mike has worked so hard to establish.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Saxon uses a “resolver” whenever it
attempts to load a document (a source document, stylesheet module,
unparsed text document, etc.). For the past few releases, the Java,
C#, and C products have been using resolvers based on the
<a href="https://xmlresolver.org/">XML Resolver APIs</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on some improvements to those APIs. It’s likely
that the next releases of Saxon will be ship with XML Resolver
6.x.</p>

<p>If you’d like to
<a href="https://xmlresolver.org/6x-snapshot/">preview the planned changes</a>
and provide feedback about how they work in your applications, that’d
be grand.</p>

<p>Just FYI, we’ve moved some things around. Some of our web
infrastructure, the way
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/">www.saxonica.com</a>
and
<a href="https://dev.saxonica.com/">dev.saxonica.com</a>
are served, for example, has changed.
Plus we have some new infrastructure for
<a href="https://downloads.saxonica.com/">downloads</a>
and 
<a href="https://maven.saxonica.com/">Maven</a>.
</p>

<p>You aren’t supposed to notice. Or, at least, it isn’t supposed to
be broken. There are redirects in place for things we know moved and
a few very old things have fallen by the wayside.</p>

<h1>ICU4J and SaxonJ EE</h1>

<p>We’ve recently discovered a small discrepancy in how we manage the
dependencies between <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/icu4j/">ICU4J</a>
and SaxonJ EE.</p>

<p>If you download the EE release from our website, you get a
distribution that includes SaxonJ EE, XML Resolver, ICU4J, and JLine
(used by Gizmo). The manifest in the SaxonJ EE jar file puts those
additional dependencies on your classpath automatically.</p>

<p>If you get the EE release from our Maven repository, ICU4J is an
<em>optional</em> dependency. So Maven won’t automatically put it on
your classpath. That’s the discrepancy.</p>

<p>Saxon EE will function without ICU4J, so it is technically
optional. I’m unsure which would be better: making it optional in both
places or non-optional in both places. Having it different certainly
seems like the worst choice and we should fix it.</p>

<p>In the short term, if you’re using Saxon EE and you want the
collations supported by ICU4J, make sure you’re also arranging for
ICU4J to be on your classpath.</p>

<p>We discovered this in the course of examining issue
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6183">#6183</a>. For slightly
complicated reasons involving our type hierarchy, if ICU4J is missing,
you can get an error message that suggests you’re running Saxon HE
even when you’re running EE. We’ll fix that too.

<p>Historically, we’ve used a customized version of
<a href="https://jeldoclet.sourceforge.net/">JELDoclet</a> to generate
XML from Javadoc. We use the XML to construct parts of our website.
The Javadoc APIs used by JELDoclet (and all of the other
Javadoc-to-XML doclets that I could lay my hands on) have been deprecated as of
Java 9 and will eventually be removed from the JDK.</p>

<p>On a whim last weekend, I took a stab at simply rebuilding an XML
doclet on top of the new Javadoc APIs. You can find the results of that
effort in the <a href="https://github.com/Saxonica/xmldoclet">xmldoclet</a> repository.
</p>

<p>It’s only version 0.1.0, but I think it’s broadly functional. It
handles all of the sources I’ve thrown at it, including the Saxon Java
products which are fairly large and complex. If you try it out and
discover that it produces output that seems incomplete or incorrect, please
<a href="https://github.com/Saxonica/xmldoclet/issues">open an issue</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t say I’m especially fond of the Javadoc APIs. In particular,
although you need to know what imports a class has in order to
correctly resolve the names of types, the public APIs provide no
access to that information. In the end, I applied an old maxim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>If brute force doesn’t work, you’re not applying enough brute force.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I simply included the Java parser that we use for the transpiler and 
parse the sources myself.</p>

<p>Comments most welcome…</p>

<p>Happy holidays everyone! Wishing you peace and joy in this festive season!</p>

<p>And toys.</p>

<p>Since we didn't get any releases out before Christmas, we've
packaged up a special treat for anyone who wants to play with
something new: SaxonC HE 12.0 in Python.</p>

<p>We've built and deployed the Python "wheels" for installing SaxonC
HE “11.99” (that's the 12.0 code base, but it's a test release so I
didn't want to use up one of the 12.x release numbers). You’ll find the
details at <a href="https://saxonica.com/saxon-c/1199/">https://saxonica.com/saxon-c/1199/</a>.
</p>

<p>If you decide to
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kick_the_tires">kick the tyres</a><sup>†</sup>,
please do let us know how it goes. There’s still work to do with
installing and packaging, but we think the API is in good shape. (I
did notice that if you call <code>compile_stylesheet()</code> and the stylesheet
isn’t well formed, the call silently returns <code>None</code> instead of raising
an error. I’ve
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/5781">reported that one</a>!)</p>

<p>I’ll probably check my email most days, but I can’t speak for
anyone else. Apologies if some of your feedback isn’t properly
addressed before the new year.</p>

<p>Once again, wishing you the happiest of holiday seasons!</p>

<h1>Signed, sealed, and delivered</h1>

<p>I have been trying to build SaxonCS for .NET such that I could deliver it
on MacOS without warning messages for
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/24337">a long time</a>.
It has not been an easy or enjoyable adventure. Here are some
breadcrumbs for the next poor soul forced to tread down this path.</p>

<p>You can’t do this with .NET 5. That’s probably less important today
than it was when I started. I don’t understand the details, but something has
been fixed in .NET 6 that isn’t going to be backported to .NET 5. (There’s
a comment to that effect in an issue, but I can’t now locate that issue.)</p>

<p>There are several problems that have to be solved. The application
has to be built such that it will run when signed. All of the various pieces
have to be (correctly) signed. A DMG must be constructed to distribute
the application (maybe I don’t <em>have</em> to do this step, but it’s
reasonably what users expect). The <em>DMG</em> has to be signed.
<em>And</em> the whole thing has to be notarized by Apple so that
it will open without warnings.</p>

<div>
<h2>The objective</h2>
<p>A complete, hands off, CI-driven build of a C# application to produce
a MacOS DMG file that a user can open and use without any warnings about
unsigned code or potentially malicious applications.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you begin, there are some things you have to have setup.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">dotnet</a> 6
(or later, I assume, but we’re planning to ship Saxon 12 with .NET 6
so that’s what I’m using).</p></li>
<li><p>You need the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools">nuget</a>
command line tool. This is distinct from the <em>nuget</em> subcommand
of the <em>dotnet</em> tool. As far as I can tell, only the former
can actually install packages.</p>
<p>On a Mac, you need the Mono framework and some
other fiddling to make it work. Because that’s the way it is. The details
are outlined on the tools page linked above.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You’ll need
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a>. I’m using version 14.2.
I think you need to install the XCode command line tools and you need to run
XCode at least once, it does a bunch of initialization the first time it runs.
</p></li>
<li><p>You need an Apple developer account and you have to go through
the dance necessary to create a developer ID certificate. The certificate
and (at least some of) the certificate chain need to be downloaded and
installed in your keychain. I don’t remember the exact details, but I seem
to recall that it was spelled out <em>reasonably</em> well in the Apple developer
documentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I decided to use
<a href="https://www.araelium.com/dmgcanvas">DMG Canvas</a> to build the
DMG. In addition to building the DMG, this application does the sign
and notarize dance with Apple for me. $20 well spent, I think. I
assume these steps can be done manually, but I’m not inspired to try
to figure out how just at the moment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the <em>nuget</em> command to install <code>Dotnet.Bundle</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ nuget install Dotnet.Bundle</code></pre>

<p>This package constructs the “bundle” of files that MacOS expects
for an application. (That’s the <code><em>application</em>.app</code> directory
and its descendants.)</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Application files</h2>

<p>Start with your application. In our case, this complex beast:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class HelloWorld
    {
        public static void Main(string[] arg)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>You will also need a <code>.csproj</code> file. Here’s one that works
for me:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;

  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;PlatformTarget&gt;AnyCPU&lt;/PlatformTarget&gt;
    &lt;DebugType&gt;pdbonly&lt;/DebugType&gt;
    &lt;Optimize&gt;true&lt;/Optimize&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net6.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;PublishSingleFile&gt;true&lt;/PublishSingleFile&gt;
    &lt;SelfContained&gt;true&lt;/SelfContained&gt;
    &lt;PublishReadyToRun&gt;true&lt;/PublishReadyToRun&gt;
    &lt;RuntimeIdentifier&gt;osx-x64&lt;/RuntimeIdentifier&gt;
    &lt;UseHardenedRuntime&gt;true&lt;/UseHardenedRuntime&gt;
    &lt;ImplicitUsings&gt;enable&lt;/ImplicitUsings&gt;
    &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
    &lt;IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract&gt;true&lt;/IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract&gt;
    &lt;IncludeSymbolsInSingleFile&gt;false&lt;/IncludeSymbolsInSingleFile&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;CFBundleName&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/CFBundleName&gt;
    &lt;CFBundleDisplayName&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/CFBundleDisplayName&gt;
    &lt;CFBundleIdentifier&gt;com.saxonica.helloworld&lt;/CFBundleIdentifier&gt;
    &lt;CFBundleVersion&gt;1.0.0&lt;/CFBundleVersion&gt;
    &lt;CFBundleShortVersionString&gt;1.0.0&lt;/CFBundleShortVersionString&gt;
    &lt;CFBundleExecutable&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/CFBundleExecutable&gt;
    &lt;CFBundleIconFile&gt;HelloWorld.icns&lt;/CFBundleIconFile&gt;
    &lt;NSPrincipalClass&gt;NSApplication&lt;/NSPrincipalClass&gt;
    &lt;NSHighResolutionCapable&gt;true&lt;/NSHighResolutionCapable&gt;
    &lt;NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance&gt;false&lt;/NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="DotNet.Bundle" Version="0.9.13" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

&lt;/Project&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The first property group specifies properties of the build, the second
defines how the application will be bundled, and the last item group is
necessary to make the bundler part of the build.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>You must specify <code>net6</code> for the framework and create
a single file, self-contained application.</li>
<li>You must use the hardened runtime.</li>
<li>You must include native libraries for self extraction.</li>
<li>You must <em>not</em> include symbols in the single file, that’s an option that
apparently stopped working in .NET 5.</li>
<li>I created <code>HelloWorld.icns</code> from a PNG with ImageMagick.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Building the application</h2>

<p>Add <code>Dotnet.Bundle</code> to the project:</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet add package Dotnet.Bundle</code></pre>

<p>(You only have to do this once.)</p>

<p>Build the application:</p>

<pre><code>$ dotnet msbuild -t:BundleApp -p:RuntimeIdentifier=osx-x64 -p:Configuration=Release</code></pre>

<p>You can run the bundled application to make sure it works:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/Release/net6.0/osx-x64/publish/HelloWorld.app/Contents/MacOS/HelloWorld
Hello, World!</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Sign the application</h2>

<p>Next we have to sign the application. But before we can do that, we have
to make an entitlements plist file. I called mine <code>entitlements.plist</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
          "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Now we can sign it:</p>

<pre><code>$ codesign --force --options runtime --entitlements ./entitlements.plist --deep \
  --sign "Developer ID Application: YOUR DEVELOPER ID GOES HERE" \
  --timestamp bin/Release/net6.0/osx-x64/publish/HelloWorld.app</code></pre>

<p>You must use the entitlements option and the timestamp option. (You probably
need all the other options too, but those were the ones that I initially 
overlooked.)</p>

<p>You can run it again to make sure it still works:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/Release/net6.0/osx-x64/publish/HelloWorld.app/Contents/MacOS/HelloWorld
Hello, World!</code></pre>

<p>(It didn’t for me for the longest time!)</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Construct the DMG</h2>

<p>Fire up the <em>DMG Canvas</em> application. (Yes, I know, I said I wanted this to
be a hands-off process. I believe <em>DMG Canvas</em> can be automated, but I haven’t
tried to figure out exactly how yet.)</p>

<p>The first time you open it up, go to the Preferences dialog and add your Apple ID
and a one-time password on the Notarization tab:</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/app-password.png" alt="Screen capture of the DMG Canvas notarization preferences tab."/>
</figure>

<p>This will enable signing and notarizing the DMG later.</p>

<p>On the main screen, add the application to the canvas. On the right hand
side, choose the second tab and select “Code Sign and Notarize” in the drop down.
You’ll have to specify the certificate you want to use, your Apple ID, and the primary
bundle ID. (I have no idea what that means in this context, but you have to put
something in there.)</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/app-main.png" alt="Screen capture of the DMG Canvas main screen with the notarization dialog shown on the right."/>
</figure>

<p>Click the “Build” button in the upper right corner, fill in the details,</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/app-build.png" alt="Screen capture of the DMG Canvas build dialog."/>
</figure>

<p>Hit Save and wait (nervously, and for quite a while) for the results!</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/app-wait.png" alt="Screen capture of the DMG Canvas modal dialog while it's building and notarizing the DMG file."/>
</figure>

<p>With luck, it all goes smoothly and you get back a signed, notarized DMG file.</p>

<p>There’s obviously more to be done in the DMG: it needs a background image, the
standard symlink to <code>/Applications</code> should be present, etc. But
I got a <a href="HelloWorld.dmg">working DMG</a> file out of it so, I’m
declaring victory for the moment.</p>

<p>We first published SaxonCS 11.x using .NET 5. Since then, .NET 5
has reached “end of life” and .NET 6 has become the recommended “long
term service” release of the .NET framework.</p>

<p>This puts us in a bit of a bind.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we try not to make disruptive changes in a
maintenance release if we can avoid it. Consequently, we’re
reluctant to suddenly require all of our customers who might be
building applications with SaxonCS 11.x to upgrade to .NET 6 just
because they want to install a new maintenance release.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is becoming difficult to support .NET 5
applications in some environments. Ubuntu 22.04, for example, doesn’t
ship with the SSL libraries that .NET 5 requires. This makes it
difficult, perhaps impossible, to deploy SaxonCS 11.x built with .NET 5 in some
environments.</p>

<p>As a compromise, we’ve published a set of SaxonCS 11.4 releases
built against .NET 6. In order to distinguish them from their .NET 5
counterparts, we’ve named them “SaxonCS-b6”. The “b6” is both a nod
towards their .NET 6 provenance and a way of identifying them as
“beta”. There are no code changes in these builds, they should perform
exactly as the SaxonCS 11.4 release does, but they have not been
tested extensively.</p>

<p>They are identified as “SaxonCS-b6 11.4.1”. You can get the
platform-specific release artifacts from our downloads area and the
NuGet package has been uploaded and should be available soon.</p>

<p>(Speaking of NuGet, I should also confess that I published the
wrong SaxonCS 11.4.0 artifact. The SaxonCS 11.4.0 release on NuGet
will only work on 64 bit platforms. I republished the corrected,
architecture independent release as SaxonCS 11.4.1 yesterday.)</p>

<p>We’ll have to cross this bridge again if we publish another Saxon
11.x maintenance release. Please let us know what works for you, and what doesn’t.</p>
