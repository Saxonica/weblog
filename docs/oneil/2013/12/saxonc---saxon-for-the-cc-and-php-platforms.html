      <p>At the XML Summer School 2013, Tony Graham presented a lightning talk about life after
         libxslt 1.0. &nbsp;I was not present for this summer school, but it was clear from the
         feedback of the discussions I received that there is a major gap of XSLT 2.0 support
         in the large developer community of C/Perl/PHP/Python/Ruby world and&nbsp;associated tools
         that rely on libxslt.<br>
         It is a known problem, which has never, to my knowledge been addressed. At Saxonica,
         we wanted to try and plug this gap by porting the Saxon processor from Java to C/C++,
         which would enable us to communicate with the languages specified above. One of our
         goals, if possible was to interface with libxml and libxslt.&nbsp;Providing such a bridge
         or cross-compiled version of a full fledged Java application
         to C/C++ is always a&nbsp;daunting&nbsp;task.&nbsp;In this blog post I discuss the technical steps
         in our quest to achieve our goals
         and give some details of the experiences gained along the way. I will begin by detailing
         the various technologies that we tried, and how we have have ended up using a commercial
         Java native compiler after several failed attempts with tools that either did not
         work, cumbersome or were just too error prone.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>LLVM</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         At the summer school there were discussions that the tool <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>&nbsp;could do the job of compiling Java to native code. As claimed on the project website
         LLVM is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
         The LLVM project seems very active with many projects using it to do various task,
         but I found it difficult to get anything working. In particular, I tried using the
         VMKit which relies on LLVM to compile some a simple 'Hello World' examples to machine
         code, but even that seemed cumbersome.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>GCJ</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         Secondly, I looked at the&nbsp;<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/java/">GCJ</a>&nbsp;technology. GCJ is a tool that I have used before, so I was confident that it would
         work. However, from my past experience using this tool is that it can be error prone
         and contains long standing bugs, which is a result of the project being dormant for
         several years, it seems unlikely that bugs will be fixed. The other worrying fact
         is that GCJ only supports up-to JDK 1.5.&nbsp;Nevertheless for lack of other options, I&nbsp;persevered
         with GCJ and&nbsp;I had much better success given that I&nbsp;managed to compile Saxon-HE to
         native machine
         code&nbsp; and actually got it to execute my example stylesheets. I had some problems because
         of classes that were not present in the GCJ implementation of JDK 1.5, such as the
         packages java.math and javax.xml. Therefore, I had to include my own version of these
         packages.
         </p>
      <p>
         The next step was to create a shared library of Saxon-HE, so that I could interface
         it with C/C++. This proved to be a real battle, which in the end I succeeded. I decided
         to use Compiled Native Interface (CNI), which presents a convenient way to write Java
         native methods using C++. The alternative was JNI (Java Native Interface), which may
         be viewed as more portable. Both interfaces though have similar principles: you need
         a Java/CNI-aware C++ compiler, any recent version of G++ is capable, and then you
         must include the header file for each Java class it uses. These header files, if not
         automatically generated, can be done using gcjh. I soon gave up on using GCJ: I stumbled
         upon a few known bugs and because if I was having major issues with the setup and
         prerequisites required then surely users would have the same problems.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>Excelsior JET</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         The <a href="http://www.excelsior-usa.com/">Excelsior JET tool</a>&nbsp;is the final technology we looked at and thankfully it is what we have ended up using
         in the alpha release. JET is a commercial product that provides a Java native compiler
         for both Linux and Windows platforms. What is good about this software tool is that
         it provides an easy to use Graphical interface to build native executables and shared
         libraries from jar file(s). It also has the feature to package up the software into
         an installer ready to be deployed onto its intended host machine. This was great for
         us!&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         There is a lot I could write about JET, but it would be a repeat of the plethora of
         information currently available on their website and forum. However, just to mention
         we&nbsp;started with their evaluation version which offers 90-days free usage of their
         software
         before purchasing the professional edition. Another point of interest is that Excelsior
         offer a free-of-charge license for use in&nbsp;conjunction&nbsp;with open-source&nbsp;software.
         </p>
      <p>
         We know that there will be some sections of the open-source community that dislike
         the dependency upon using a commercial tool, but it is not that dissimilar from the
         early years of Java when the Sun compiler was freely available but not open-sourced.
         &nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>Implementation notes using JET</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         After creating the shared library, to interface it with C/C++ I used JNI. It is possible
         to use JET's own Java interface to external functions called xFunction, which is recommended
         if starting from scratch, but having used JNI with GCJ I continued with that approach.
         To get started there are a few examples of invoking a library with C/C++. In essence,
         you need to load the library and initialize the JET run-time before you can use it,
         see the code below (from the file xsltProcessor.cc):
         </p>
      <pre><code>/* Load dll. */
HANDLE loadDll(char* name)
{
  HANDLE hDll = LoadLibrary (name);

  if (!hDll) {
    printf ("Unable to load %s\n", name);
    exit(1);
  }

  printf ("%s loaded\n", name);
  return hDll;
}

extern "C" {jint (JNICALL * JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs_func) (void *args);
            jint (JNICALL * JNI_CreateJavaVM_func) (JavaVM **pvm, void **penv, void *args);
}

/*Initialize JET run-time.*/
extern "C" void initJavaRT(HANDLE myDllHandle, JavaVM** pjvm, JNIEnv** penv)
{
  int result;
  JavaVMInitArgs args;

  JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs_func =
  (jint (JNICALL *) (void *args))
  GetProcAddress (myDllHandle, "JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs");
  JNI_CreateJavaVM_func =
  (jint (JNICALL *) (JavaVM **pvm, void **penv, void *args))
  GetProcAddress (myDllHandle, "JNI_CreateJavaVM");

  if(!JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs_func) {
    printf ("%s doesn't contain public JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs\n", dllname);
    exit (1);
  }

  if(!JNI_CreateJavaVM_func) {
    printf ("%s doesn't contain public JNI_CreateJavaVM\n", dllname);
    exit (1);
  }

  memset (&amp;args, 0, sizeof(args));
  args.version = JNI_VERSION_1_2;
  result = JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs_func(&amp;args);
  if (result != JNI_OK) {
    printf ("JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs() failed with result %d\n", result);
    exit(1);
  }

  /* NOTE: no JVM is actually created
  * this call to JNI_CreateJavaVM is intended for JET RT initialization
  */
  result = JNI_CreateJavaVM_func (pjvm, (void **)penv, &amp;args);
  if (result != JNI_OK) {
    printf ("JNI_CreateJavaVM() failed with result %d\n", result);
    exit(1);
  }
  printf ("JET RT initialized\n");
  fflush (stdout);
}

XsltProcessor::XsltProcessor(bool license) {
  /* * First of all, load required component.
  * By the time of JET initialization, all components should be loaded.
  */
  myDllHandle = loadDll (dllname);

  /*
  * Initialize JET run-time.
  * The handle of loaded component is used to retrieve Invocation API.
  */
  initJavaRT (myDllHandle, &amp;jvm, &amp;env);

  /* Look for class.*/
  cppClass = lookForClass(env, "net/sf/saxon/option/cpp/XsltProcessorForCpp");
  versionClass = lookForClass(env, "net/sf/saxon/Version");

  cpp = createObject (env, cppClass, "(Z)V", license);
  jmethodID debugMID = env-&gt;GetStaticMethodID(cppClass, "setDebugMode", "(Z)V");
  if(debugMID){
    env-&gt;CallStaticVoidMethod(cppClass, debugMID, (jboolean)false);
  }
  ....
}
...</code></pre>
      <p>In the constructor method of XsltProcessor we see that once we have loaded the library
         and initialized the JET run-time we can now make calls to the environment, which has
         been created to get class definitions and create instance(s) of the class in the Java
         world. This is before we make method calls on the object.

         <b>PHP Extension in C/C++</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         After successfully getting XSLT transformations to work within C/C++, the next step
         was to try and develop a PHP extension, which would operate like libxslt. There is
         a lot of material on the web and books in regards to PHP extensions and I found the
         following guide very useful:&nbsp;<a href="http://devzone.zend.com/1435/wrapping-c-classes-in-a-php-extension/">http://devzone.zend.com/1435/wrapping-c-classes-in-a-php-extension/</a>. I literally followed it step-by-step, adding a few steps of my own when I worked
         out what I was doing.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>Testing</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         As a proof of concept I wrote a test harness in PHP which makes use of the PHP extension
         (see: xslt30TestSuite.php in the download library).&nbsp;This is a test driver designed
         to run the public W3C XSLT test suite at <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/xslt30-test/">https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/xslt30-test/</a>. The test driver in its current form requires Saxon-EE, which is not yet available
         in this alpha release; nevertheless, the program may serve as a useful example of
         how the API can be used. Note that it is written to use libXML to read the test catalog,
         but to use Saxon for running the tests and assessing the results.
         </p>
      <p>
         <b>Performance Testing</b>
         </p>
      <p>
         I now draw comparisons between running Saxon-HE (on Java) vs running Saxon-HE/C on
         C++ and on PHP on some preliminary tests. I also compare these times to libxslt (C/C++).
         An important aim is to get a good measure of the costs of crossing the Java/C++ boundary
         using JNI and also to see what the effect is with the PHP extension.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         I used Saxon-HE 9.5.1.3 as the baseline. The test machine was a Intel Core i5 processor
         430M laptop with 4GB memory, 2.26Ghz CPU and 3MB L3 cache, running Ubuntu 13.10 Linux.
         Servers Apache2 and PHP version 5.5.3-1ubuntu2. The compiler was Sun/Oracle Java 1.6.0.43.&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         The experiments were based on the XMark benchmark. I used query q8, which was converted
         into the stylesheet below. The choice of q8.xsl is because we should expect some performance
         bottle-necks across the implementations due to its&nbsp;equijoins in the query:
         </p>
      <pre>&lt;result xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xsl:version="2.0"&gt;
&lt;!-- Q8.  List the names of persons and the number of items they bought.
          (joins person, closed_auction) --&gt;

  &lt;xsl:for-each select="/site/people/person"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:variable name="a"
       select="/site/closed_auctions/closed_auction[buyer/@person = current()/@id]"/&gt;
    &lt;item person="{name}"&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="count($a)"/&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;

&lt;/result&gt;</pre>
      <p>
         The running times of executing q8.xsl on the document xmark64.xml, which is a 64MB
         size document are as follows:
         </p>
      <p>
         Saxon-HE (Java): &nbsp; &nbsp;60.5&nbsp;seconds
         </p>
      <p>
         Saxon-HE/C (C++): 132 seconds&nbsp;
         </p>
      <p>
         Saxon-HE/C (PHP): 137&nbsp;seconds
         </p>
      <p>
         libxslt (C/C++): &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;213 seconds
         </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Update on the times reported for Saxon-HE/C as a result of optimizations in the
            JET compiler.</li>
         <li>Code used to get libxslt time taken from:&nbsp;<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/tutorial/libxslttutorial.html">http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/tutorial/libxslttutorial.html</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The times for Saxon-HE/C are without the cost of&nbsp;JET initialisation and loading the
         library, which accounted for only 4 seconds.&nbsp;So we observe that there is not a big
         overhead between C++ and the PHP
         extension. The biggest cost as expected is between Java and C++, where we see on the
         C++/PHP platform a slowdown of ~ x2.2. We also observe that Saxon-HE/C out performs
         libxslt on C/C++ by ~40% on q8.
         </p>
