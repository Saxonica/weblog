      <p>I would like to report on some Saxon performance measure on a Word ladder solution
         implemented in XSLT.</p>
      <p>Firstly, some background information on the Word ladder problem. From Wikipedia, the
         free encyclopedia:</p>
      <p>A <b>word ladder</b> (also known as a <b>doublets</b>, <b>word-links</b>, or <b>Word golf</b>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game">word game</a> invented by Lewis Carroll<a title="Lewis Carroll" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll"></a>.
         A word ladder puzzle begins with two given words, and to solve the 
         puzzle one must find the shortest chain of other words to link the two 
         given words, in which chain every two adjacent words (that is, words in 
         successive steps) differ by exactly by one letter.</p>
      <p>XSLT interest in this problem was first started (to the best of my knowledge) by Dimitre
         Novatchev through the <a href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/lists.mulberrytech.com/xsl-list/archives/201211/msg00187.html">mulberry mailing list</a>, who provides a 20 step guide to create a stylesheet in his blog to solve the Word
         ladder problem (<a href="http://dev.saxonica.com/oneil/FindChainOfWordsHamming.xsl">FindChainOfWordsHamming.xsl</a>). Following the post on the list, there has been some interest; another solution
         to this problem was given by Wolfgang Laun (please see <a href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/lists.mulberrytech.com/xsl-list/archives/201211/msg00210.html">thread</a>, file: <a href="http://dev.saxonica.com/oneil/FindChainOfWordsHamming2.xsl">FindChainOfWordsHamming2.xsl</a>).</p>
      <p><b>Experimental Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>Our interest resides in the Saxon performances only. I was curious and surprised by
         the results reported by Dimitre. The question I had is why Dimitre's stylesheet was
         much slower than Wolfgang's stylesheet in Saxon and faster in another XSLT processor:
         there must be some optimization step we were not making. I was motivated to understand
         were the bottle necks were and how we could improve the performance in Saxon.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang wrote: "The XSLT program is three times faster on one XSLT implementation
         than on another one is strange, 'very' strange". </p>
      <p>Mike Kay addressed Wolfgang's comment by writing in the thread: "No, it's extremely
         common. In fact, very much larger factors than this 
         are possible. Sometimes Saxon-EE runs 1000 times faster than Saxon-HE. 
         This effect is normal with declarative languages where powerful 
         optimizations are deployed - SQL users will be very familiar with the 
         effect."</p>
      <p>The table below shows the execution times of the stylesheets in Saxon 9.XX (for some
         recent X). Time were reported by Dimitre.</p>
      <table border="1">
         
         
         <tbody>
            
            
            <tr>
               
               
               <th>Transformation</th>
               
               
               <th>Times (secs)</th>
               </tr>
            
            
            
            <tr>
               
               
               
               <td>Dimitre</td>
               
               
               <td>39</td>
               </tr>
            
            
            
            <tr>
               
               
               
               <td>Wolfgang</td>
               
               
               <td>25</td>
               </tr>
            </tbody>
         </table>
      <p>We observe that Wolfgang's transformation is 1.56 times faster. Please note that with
         Wolfgang's stylesheet his results lists all solutions (i.e. ladders), whereas Dimitre
         only finds one.</p>
      <p>Saxon represents a stylesheet as a compiled abstract syntax tree (AST) which is processed
         in a interpreted manner. Since the release of Saxon 9.4 we have included the bytecode
         generation feature, which allows us at the compilation phase to generate directly
         the byte code representation of the entire AST or sub-trees of it where performance
         benefits can be achieved. We make use of properties we know at compile time (See <a href="http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Delpratt01/BalisageVol7-Delpratt01.html">full paper</a>).</p>
      <p><b>Analysis of Dimitre's Stylesheet</b></p>
      <p>Step one was to see how well Saxon does with the bytecode feature switched on. This
         proved inconclusive because we discovered a bug in the bytecode generated. A useful
         exercise already, we managed to fix the bug (see bug issue: <a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/1653">#1653</a>). The problem was in the function processQueue the tail recursive call was not being
         properly generated into bytecode. </p>
      <p>The Table below shows running times of the stylesheets under Saxon 9.4.0.6. We observe
         that Wolfgang's stylesheet was 2.07 and 3.22 faster in Saxon Intepreted and bytecode,
         respectively.</p>

               </tr>

         </table>
      <p>Analyzing Dimitre's stylesheet with the Saxon tracing profile (i.e. option -TP) proved
         useful. See the html output produced by Saxon below. We observe that there is a big
         hit on the processNode method, with the most time spent in this function.</p>

      <p>In addition to the Saxon tracing profile I ran the Java hrof profiling tool, which
         showed up that most time was spent in comparing strings. See the Java profile results
         below. It was now obvious that the GeneralComparison expression was in question. Specifically
         we narrowed it down to the instruction: <code>&lt;xsl:for-each select="$vNeighbors[not(. = $pExcluded)]"&gt;</code>. For the interpreted code we were doing some unnecessary runtime type checking when
         we know statically at compile time that we are comparing string values. More Specifically,
         we know at compile time that $vNeighbors is a sequence of untyped atomic values and
         $pExcluded is a sequence of strings. We were unnecessarily checking at runtime that
         untyped atomic and string literal were comparable and we were doing an unnecessary
         conversion from an untyped atomic to string.&nbsp; </p>

      <p><b>Improvements in Bytecode generation</b></p>
      <p>In the bytecode we discovered we were missing out on opportunities to capitalise on
         static properties we know at compile time. For example during atomization we were
         doing an instanceof test to see whether each item was a node when we already know
         from static analysis that this was the case. We were also able to avoid unnecessary
         conversions of the strings, checking of instanceof and we found we could avoid repeated
         conversions by saving of string values for reuse when appropriate.</p>
      <p>With the code improvements discussed above we were able to apply them in Saxon-EE
         9.5 (pre-release). The table below shows these running times on the stylesheet written
         by Dimitre and Wolfgang. We observe that in the interpreted code that Wolfgang's XSL
         is 2.13 times faster than Dimitre (This is similar to Dimitre results above). With
         the bytecode generation feature switched on: Dimitre's stylesheet has dramatically
         improved in performance and is now 1.19 times faster than Wolfgang's XSL.</p>
