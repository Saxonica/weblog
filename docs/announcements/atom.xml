</div></content></entry><entry><title>SaxonC Python 12.8 for Python 3.14</title><link href="https://blog.saxonica.com/announcements/2025/08/saxon-12.8-for-python-3.14.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><id>https://blog.saxonica.com/announcements/2025/08/saxon-12.8-for-python-3.14.html</id><published>2025-08-14T11:15:00Z</published><content type="xhtml" xml:base="https://blog.saxonica.com/announcements/2025/08/saxon-12.8-for-python-3.14.html"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">


<p>With the recent release of Python 3.14.0rc1, the ABI for Python 3.14 is
final, and any SaxonC Python wheels we build against it will also work with
the final 3.14 release. The TL;DR is that we’ve done that, and you can
<code>pip install saxonche</code> (or <code>saxoncee</code> /
<code>saxoncpe</code>) with the 3.14.0rc1 release right now.</p>

<p>The Python 3.13 release was trickier for us to deal with than it should have
been – our build processes required a lot more manual intervention for different
Python versions than we liked, and we had to wait for a new Saxon release to get
wheels built for Python 3.13, which was frustrating.</p>

<p>We’ve been working on improving our build processes and making  it easier to
build Python wheels across all the platforms and Python versions we support. Easy
enough, in fact, that we were able to test Python 3.14 support back at the beta
stage, and were ready to build SaxonC Python 12.8 against 3.14 as soon as the RC
dropped and the ABI was stable.</p>

<p>These new wheels were built from the same commit as the all the other SaxonC
Python 12.8 wheels for Python 3.9-3.13. We’d love for you to install 12.8 for 3.14
and kick the tires: since Python 3.14 is still RC and not at the final release stage,
there may be some problems we haven't come across. If you run into any problems,
please report them on the
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/projects/saxon-c/issues">SaxonC issue tracker</a>.
</p>

<p>There are wheels for the same platforms as always – macOS x86_64 and arm64,
Linux x86_64 and aarch64, and Windows x86_64. For macOS x86_64, Python 3.14 now
requires macOS 11 or later. As a result, Python 3.14 wheels of SaxonC Python 12.8
require macOS 11 or later on x86_64 too.</p>

<p>The accompanying release announcements for
<a href="saxon-11.7.html">Saxon 11.7</a> and
<a href="saxon-12.8.html">Saxon 12.8</a> describe those
releases in detail. This post summarizes why we decided that we
needed to release them both this week.</p>

<p>Some applications are known to use Saxon to run untrusted, user-submitted
stylesheets or queries. Running untrusted code always entails some risk. Saxon
provides two
<a href="https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!configuration/config-features">features</a>
designed to help mitigate this risk: <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> and

<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code>. Setting <code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code>
can limit what resources a stylesheet or query can access; it can for example,
forbid access to file: URIs. The <code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature
can disable access to reflexive Java extension functions, some system
properties, and some other extension functions. (The remit of the
<code>ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> feature is a little wider than you might
expect.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we discovered a function in Saxon 11 and 12 that was not
adequately controlled by these features. In principle, a stylesheet or query
running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE could access the local filesystem even if the
<code>ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS</code> feature was set to forbid such access. The risk
is small: it only applies to untrusted code running in Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE (it
does not apply to Saxon-HE) on a system where reading from the local filesystem
would be deemed a risk. (We would encourage anyone running untrusted code to use
a sandboxed environment where there is no data on the filesystem that needs to
be protected from read access.)</p>

<p>Although we judge the risk to be small, At Saxonica, we take security
seriously and we are publishing maintenance releases of Saxon 11 and Saxon 12 to
close this gap. We urge anyone running untrusted stylesheets or queries under
Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE to move to version 11.7 or 12.8 immediately.</p>

<p>This bug is present in the Java, C#, C, C++, Python and PHP products. It is
not present in Saxon 10 (including the Saxon.NET 10) or in earlier releases. It
is not present in SaxonJS.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonJS-HE 3.0.0-beta2!</h1>

<p>SaxonJS 3.0 is a major update to the SaxonJS product. In June 2025, we are
publishing a second preview release, version 3.0.0-beta2. This is a preview
release of the SaxonJS 3.0 HE (Home Edition) product. An EE (Enterprise Edition)
product is in the works.
</p>

<div>
<h2>New features in the beta2 release</h2>

<p>This release includes a few bug fixes from the first beta.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/5923">5923</a>
   Provide a way to control event listener parameters</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6599">6599</a>
   Sequence interacts badly with try/catch</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6697">6697</a>
   Checksum checking in SaxonJS 3</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6742">6742</a>
   Untethered promises with SaxonJS 3.0.0-beta1</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the most consequential is probably 6697. In the course of fixing a
bug related to SEF files produced for SaxonJS 2, we introduced a bug where
SaxonJ 12.6 couldn’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta1! That’s been fixed.
You can now produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with Saxon 12.6 or later.
(Unfortunately, you can’t produce SEF files for SaxonJS 3.0 beta2 with SaxonJ
12.5 or earlier!)

<h2>Issues resolved</h2>

<p>The substantial changes in this release are:</p>

<ol>
<li>We’ve returned to supporting JDK 8 in 12.7. The decision to move to JDK 11
in 12.6 was intentional, but perhaps too eager. Fair warning: it is very
unlikely that Saxon 13 will be released with support for JDK 8.</li>
<li>We worked around a bug that caused the SaxonC products to fail under X86 emulation
on Windows/ARM. (The bug is that Windows emulation doesn’t support some modern
instructions that GraalVM was generating. We worked around it by turning down some
GraalVM optimizations in that environment.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Issues in SaxonC</h3>

<p>In the SaxonC 12.6 release, we have included a compiled C++ API library
(.dll, .so, .dylib as appropriate) along with accompanying CMake files to
simplify integration into C++ applications. This is provided in addition to the
core SaxonC library, which continues to be cross-compiled using GraalVM.</p>

<p>To use SaxonC in a C++ project, users now only need the two compiled library
files and the header files—greatly reducing setup complexity. Integrating with a
project already using CMake is as simple as using FindPackage(SaxonCHE 12.6.0)
(Or SaxonCEE, or SaxonCPE, if using the EE or PE editions). A sample CMake
project is provided with the samples in the download ZIP.</p>

<p>This change applies only to the C++ API. It does not affect the PHP or Python extensions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>PHP</dt>
<dd>Installation instructions are included in the README file in the download
ZIP and also available in the online documentation.</dd>
<dt>Python</dt>
<dd>The extension is distributed as pre-built wheels via PyPI, making
installation straightforward using pip.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to the individual issues listed below, this release fixes a
number of multithreading issues, encoding problems, and memory leaks. API
support has been added for getcwd, getProperty/getProperties, and
getJustInTimeCompilation on several objects. There have also been a number
of documentation improvements.</p>

<h3>Promises</h3>

<p>SaxonJS 3 introduces new mechanisms for enabling asynchronous processing
using promises. A new instruction <code>ixsl:promise</code> is introduced which
can be used as a replacement for the existing <code>ixsl:schedule-action</code>
instruction.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The new instruction can now call any asychronous function to fetch any kind of
resource. Adding new kinds of resource is just a question of implementing new
functions (which can be user-written functions as well as system-supplied
functions). So if you want to fetch data from a SQL database, for example, you
can easily write a function to do that.</li>
<li>The machinery for handling asynchronous requests is now closely aligned with
JavaScript promises, both in terms of the conceptual design, and the
implementation. This makes it much easier to understand for users familiar
with the JavaScript processing model.</li>
<li>The mechanism takes advantage of XDM higher-order functions. (Note, however,
that it still “bends” the pure declarative approach of XPath by introducing
mutability. A promise, for example, is a mutable object, so you need to
exercise care for example if you bind it to a variable.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that for Node.js, run time use of ixsl:promise is an EE feature. So XSLT
stylesheets using <code>ixsl:promise</code> can be compiled to SEF with the XX
compiler in SaxonJS without a JS-EE license, and then run in the browser; but to
run such a stylesheet on Node.js requires SaxonJS-EE and a valid JS-EE license.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>JavaScript extension functions</h3>

<p>JavaScript developers have easy access to a huge variety of tools and
libraries distributed as JavaScript packages through <code>npm</code> and other
mechanisms. We want to make those libraries easily accessible for SaxonJS
developers too.
</p>

<p>In SaxonJS 3, you can define extension functions in JavaScript and call them
directly from XPath, both from <code>SaxonJS.XPath.evaluate</code> and from
within XSLT stylesheets running on SaxonJS in the browser or on Node.js.
</p>

<p>This opens up whole new horizons for SaxonJS developers.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Smaller changes and improvements</h3>

<p>While a lot of our focus has been on larger improvements, a few less dramatic
features are also debuting in beta1.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Support XPath expressions (other than “.”) after ? in <code>xsl:result-document</code></li>
<li>New methods on <code>xsl:result-document</code>: <code>ixsl:replace-element</code>, <code>ixsl:insert-before</code>, and
<code>ixsl:insert-after</code></li>
<li>Improved support for following HTTP redirects</li>
<li>Improved support for accessing JavaScript objects with <code>ixsl:set-property</code>, <code>ixsl:json-parse</code>,
<code>ixsl:new</code>, <code>ixsl:apply</code>, <code>ixsl:call</code>, <code>ixsl:eval</code>, and <code>ixsl:get</code></li>
<li>Support the <code>escape-solidus</code> option when generating JSON.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h2>New features coming soon</h2>

<p>Eager to publish a release, at this stage, we’ve opted only to publish the HE
version of SaxonJS 3.0 as beta1. More work is planned before the general
release, including SaxonJS 3.0 EE.
</p>

<div>
<h3>SaxonJS-EE</h3>

<p>SaxonJS-HE will remain a free product, but in 2025 we will also be introducing a
licensed version of SaxonJS, SaxonJS-EE. The licensed version will provide additional
features on Node.js (such as built-in EXPath and Saxon extension functions).
</p>

<p>The promises API run time will be a licensed feature on Node.js.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Calling XSLT functions from JavaScript</h3>

<p>Many transformations, on XML and JSON, are easier to define in XSLT than in
JavaScript. XSLT has a rich vocabulary of instructions for describing, constructing,
and transforming data in a clear, descriptive, and functional way.
</p>

<p>We anticipate making those features more accessible to JavaScript developers by
allowing JavaScript to call functions defined in XSLT.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Adding a SaxonJS.compile API</h3>

<p>The ability to construct an XSLT stylesheet and then compile it directly for
use in the current transformation is a powerful feature. A new API for doing this,
<code>SaxonJS.compile</code>, will be added in the general release.
</p>
</div>

<div>

<h1>Announcing SaxonC 12.4.2!</h1>

<p>A SaxonC 12.4.2 maintenance release has been published. This
release fixes several issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6197">6197</a> A segmentation fault in the PHP extension</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6273">6273</a> A change in the way whitespace is handled in filenames</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6274">6274</a> An problem with the “encoding” keyword in the python saxon processor</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6277">6277</a> A build configuration issue for the SaxonC HE Python processor</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6288">6288</a> A build issue for the SaxonC PHP extension</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6294">6294</a> A segmentation fault parsing JSON</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6301">6301</a> A compile error related to memory allocation with some C++ compilers</li>
<!--
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6304">6304</a> An issue when using multiple threads from the Python processor</li>
-->
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6306">6306</a> Unreleased memory in the Python processor</li>
<li><a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6324">6324</a>  A segmentation fault in the Python extension</li>
</ul>

<p>Some efforts have also been made to improve the way dynamic
libraries are referenced when using the C/C++ APIs directly. These
changes are reflected in the builds and in the scripts that compile
the “command” and “samples” applications.</p>

<p>In brief: on macOS, the dynamic library can be accessed through
<code>@rpath</code> and on Linux, the dynamic library can be placed in a standard
location or accessed with the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.
On Windows, apparently the standard practice is to place the DLL in the same
directory as the executable.</p>

<h1>Announcing SaxonC 12.4.1!</h1>

<p>A SaxonC 12.4.1 maintenance release has been published. This
release fixes <a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6268">a build
error</a> on the Windows platform and includes one additional
patch.</p>

<p>I’m an ardent believer in build automation and reproducibility
through scripting. We’ve made a lot of progress in this area, but
Windows is still a bit “hands on.” Problem is, it was my hands and I
messed up.</p>

<p>A while back, we considered upgrading to a newer version of
GraalVM. In the course of testing that, I upgraded the version on the
Windows build machine. But ultimately, we decided not to make that
upgrade.</p>

<p>Despite having an explicit note in my release checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>☑ Check the version of GraalVM</li>
</ul>

<p>I missed it on the Windows box. A lot of good detective work went
into trying to figure out what was going on, but in the end, just
building with the “right” version of GraalVM fixed it. Apologies to
the team and everyone else for that.</p>

<p>The 12.4.1 release also includes a
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/6182">partial fix</a> for
issues relating to UTF-8 string-based C API functions. Unfortunately,
a more complete fix was deemed too risky for what was otherwise an
“emergency” release. That fix will have to wait for next time.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of what’s new in 12.4, please see the original
<a href="../11/saxon-12.4.html">release announcement</a>.</p>
