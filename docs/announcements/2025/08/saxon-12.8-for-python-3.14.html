<p>With the recent release of Python 3.14.0rc1, the ABI for Python 3.14 is
final, and any SaxonC Python wheels we build against it will also work with
the final 3.14 release. The TL;DR is that we’ve done that, and you can
<code>pip install saxonche</code> (or <code>saxoncee</code> /
<code>saxoncpe</code>) with the 3.14.0rc1 release right now.</p>

<p>The Python 3.13 release was trickier for us to deal with than it should have
been – our build processes required a lot more manual intervention for different
Python versions than we liked, and we had to wait for a new Saxon release to get
wheels built for Python 3.13, which was frustrating.</p>

<p>We’ve been working on improving our build processes and making  it easier to
build Python wheels across all the platforms and Python versions we support. Easy
enough, in fact, that we were able to test Python 3.14 support back at the beta
stage, and were ready to build SaxonC Python 12.8 against 3.14 as soon as the RC
dropped and the ABI was stable.</p>

<p>These new wheels were built from the same commit as the all the other SaxonC
Python 12.8 wheels for Python 3.9-3.13. We’d love for you to install 12.8 for 3.14
and kick the tires: since Python 3.14 is still RC and not at the final release stage,
there may be some problems we haven't come across. If you run into any problems,
please report them on the
<a href="https://saxonica.plan.io/projects/saxon-c/issues">SaxonC issue tracker</a>.
</p>

<p>There are wheels for the same platforms as always – macOS x86_64 and arm64,
Linux x86_64 and aarch64, and Windows x86_64. For macOS x86_64, Python 3.14 now
requires macOS 11 or later. As a result, Python 3.14 wheels of SaxonC Python 12.8
require macOS 11 or later on x86_64 too.</p>
